       "['Conrad et al. ( 2009) show that allergic risk can also be modulated by microbial exposure before birth. mice born to dams exposed to bacteria during pregnancy were less likely to develop allergic responses than those born to unexposed mothers. infants from atopic families who were at high risk for developing allergic disease had reduced numbers of immunocompetent t cells in the circulation. This gut - centric view has been challenged by findings from landmark human studies relating to asthma and allergy in traditional farming communities. These epidemiological studies defined a unique gradient in allergy and asthma prevalence between children born into traditional farming families and their rural and urban counterparts. A major international research effort has now developed to characterize the underlying immunological processes. 5 - 13-yr - old children of farm - exposed mothers displayed reduced rates of sensitization and increased tlr2, tlr4, and cd14 gene expression in pbmcs. These findings raise the intriguing possibility that appropriate stimulation of the maternal immune system during pregnancy may generate signals capable of educating the fetal immune system. There is some evidence that supports prenatal programming. Mice given repeated intranasal treatments with a. lwoffi during pregnancy developed strong resistance to experimental atopic asthma development. The resistance to eosinophilia , goblet cell hyperplasia , and airway hyperresponsiveness after challenge was independent of changes in specific ige. The protective effect was dependent on intact maternal tlr signaling. A. lwoffii is a potent mediator of the transplacental effects observed. There is no reason to believe that this organism is unique in this regard , and indeed the authors report qualitatively similar effects with other microbial agents. Homeostatic regulation of the immunological milieu of the placenta has traditionally been far removed from the normal purview of allergy / asthma researchers. The effects observed in the mouse placenta by intranasal exposure to a. lwoffi may occur in part via this indirect route rather than exclusively by the direct passage of cytokines into decidual tissue itself. The findings have established a potentially important set of principles relating to maternal environmental exposure during pregnancy and subsequent immune functions in offspring.',\n",
       " ' ade storms are one of the largest in the world capable of transporting billion of tons of mineral dust from the northwest african region of sahara - sahel to the caribbean and the americas. It also contributes to dust transport into the south region of europe and to the east coast of asia. It has been reported that approximately half of the bacterial population isolated from ade particles are gram - negative containing enx , also known as lipopolysaccharide ( lps )  bronchial epithelium represents the first line of pulmonary defense. It is capable of recognizing microorganisms and their products. It secrets antimicrobial factors and other molecules involved in inflammatory responses. These molecules have been associated with the biological action ( e.g. , inflammatory effects ) of ambient particles in in vitro and in vivo models. This study aims to study the toxicological and proinflammatory contribution of biological constituents ( enx) present in puerto rican ade pm10 collected at a rural and urban environment in vitro. The beas-2b cell line was employed for that purpose since it is suitable and one of the models most affected by the interaction , deposition , and toxic effects of air pollution particles. An ade day was defined as a day characterized by a pm10 concentration above the background level of 18.3  g / m with a concurrent presence of aerosol clouds over pr. A day before and one to two days after the event were also considered as ade. Ade input was analyzed to assess the frequency event arrival pattern to pr. Human bronchial epithelial cells ( beas-2b , atcc # crl-9609 ) were cultured and maintained with keratinocyte growth medium ( kgm-2 , walkersville , md ) at 37c , 5% co2. Cells from passages 4469 were grown in 96-well plates and exposed for 24  hr to different ade / non - ade pm10 organic ( 510  g / ml range ) extract concentrations in three independent experiments. Multiplex bead assays are solid phase immunoassays that allow simultaneous quantitative detection theoretically of up to 100 analytes in a single microtiter by flow cytometry. The median fluorescence intensities of fluorochrome - conjugated antibodies bound to individual microspheres are derived from the flow analysis of 100 microsphere per well ( in duplicate ) The mrna expression of tlrs and coreceptor cd14 were determined using quantitative real - time pcr at exposure times of 12  hr and 7  hr. Nuclear extracts ( 5  g protein) were evaluated in three to four independent experiments using the transam nf-b enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) based kit. absorbance was measured on a spectrophotometer ( bio - rad , hercules , ca ) at 450  nm. statistical significance was set at p  0.05 and results were graphed using the graphpad instat 3 software. A reevaluation of pediatric claims for 2004 shows that march has the highest number of asthma cases with the most significant affected category being children between 0 and 5 years of age. The number of 05 years cases for san juan was significantly higher than those for fajardo ; however that was not observed for the 612 and 1318 age ranges. Pmb pretreatment to the extract reduced significantly the inherent toxicity of the urban site both derived from ade and non - ade material. Enx inhibition was able to significantly decrease both interleukin levels induced by the urban ade organic extract. All ade extracts induced tlr expression with the exception of tlr4 by the rural extract. Analysis of mean ade duration per year and monthly mean from 20002012 , compared to pm10 concentration for the urban site, undoubtedly supports the use of pm10 derived from march 2004. The difference observed between march and june could be explained by various factors such as the difference between ade occurrence and composition. The high number of cases reported during the fall and winter months could be attributed to other biological or chemical components. The use of the enx inhibitor ( pmb) demonstrated the importance of endotoxins on lung cell toxicity to urban pm10 organic extracts. The effect was not observed in the rural extracts , indicating that enx derived from urban local emissions are potent mediators of toxicity. These molecules are one of the most important and studied pm constituents. The toxins appear higher in the puerto rican urban environment. This supports the hypothesis that human activity modifies the environment enhancing enx enrichment. The release of il-6 and il-8 was partial but predominantly reduced upon pmb pretreatment demonstrating the importance of enx involvement in this response.  enx are recognized by tlrs ( mostly tlr4 and partially tlr2 ) on the bronchial epithelial cell surface. Both tlRS were found to be induced by organic extracts, but the tl4 exhibited the stronger effect in beas-2b after exposure to the urban ade extract. pretreatment with pmb was able to reduce tlr 4 expression , indicating the importance of enx in positively regulating its own receptor expression. Nf-b transcription factor is a key player for cytokine induction. It was stimulated after 4  hrs by ade organic extracts only from the urban site. This activation was directly related to enx. diesel exhaust particles have also been reported to activate this factor in beas-2b. The enx were identified as one of the unique components being incorporated in the local puerto rican environment. The enx interactive complex formed in the environment associates with pm10 and strongly activates and induces tlr4 expression while weakly affecting tlr2. This tlr interaction triggers the signal transduction pathway of nf-b leading to the release of proinflammatory il-6 and il-8. Using the correct treatments to avoid respiratory and cardiovascular exacerbations during a pollution episode ( e.g. , ade ) can be beneficial.',\n",
       " 'Aptamers are ligand sequences that bind specific target molecules with high affinity and specificity. aptamers have emerged as a class of molecules that rival antibodies especially in diagnostic and biosensing applications. In the presence of or upon binding to the target , conformational changes in the aptamer manifest themselves as changes in fluorescence. We use a number of commercially available nucleic - acid - binding dyes for monitoring aptamer - target interactions. We monitor the formation of the fluorescent complex by nucleic acid and chromophore in the presence and absence of cognate target. Our study reveals that the chromophores sybr green and thiazole orange ( to ) can be used across rna and dna aptamers.  dna / rna synthesizer using standard phosphoramidite chemistry and reagents from glen research. oligonucleotides were ammonia deprotected at 55c overnight and purified using low - melting gel electrophoresis or using reverse - phase cartridges. absorbance values of purified sequences were obtained at 25c and ph 7.0 phosphate buffer and used to calculate the working concentrations of our sequences. The chromophores being used in this assay are almost nonfluorescent when free in solution but exhibit a strong increase in fluorescence quantum yield when bound to single or double - stranded dna. Structural perturbations in the nucleic acid aptamers upon binding cognate targets are expected to generate measurable changes in the fluorescence binding behavior of chromophore. The behavior of yoyo as per the signaling strategy described above is shown in figure 3. binding of thrombin by tba leads to a significant drop in fluorescent emission of yyo thereby indicating sensitivity of the dye to conformational changes in aptamer. There is little variation in the fluorescence change of yoyo even when the chromophore concentration is varied over an order of magnitude. ethidium bromide only exhibits poor fluorescence changes in the presence versus absence of thrombin. The relatively short sequence of tba and corresponding compact structure offer fewer sites for Chromophore binding compared to the atp aptamer. We tested the intercalating dyes , to , sybr green , and yoyo, on an rna theophylline aptamer. The aptamer - dye pairs that provided the best fluorescence response were also the most sensitive towards target concentration. Finally we tested our approach for selectivity of an aptamer towards its cognate target. oyo in presence of lysozyme as compared to thrombin. These results demonstrate the selectivity of our approach using nucleic acid staining dyes for detecting aptamer - target interactions. The success of the strategy depends in large part on the affinity and specificity of the aptamer for its cognate target.',\n",
       " 'In 2000, meschia et al. developed the questionnaire for verifying stroke - free status ( qvsfs ) as a method for verifying the stroke free phenotype in participants of clinical , epidemiological and genetic studies. having one or more affirmative answers to any of the questionnaire was associated with finding stroke or tia on medical record review. This instrument could have tremendous potential in developing countries where stroke prevalence is increasing. In these low literacy settings the lack of knowledge of stroke symptoms might impact negatively on the performance of stroke symptom questionnaires. There is a lack of specific medical terminology for symptoms of stroke in local dialects across sub - saharan africa. This study seeks to validate the 8-item qvsfs at 5 centers in nigeria and ghana. The original questionnaire developed by meschia et al. will be translated into the local languages. Another version of the questionnaire will be developed where question items 3 to 8 will have line pictures of the neurological symptoms being elicited by the interviewer. Participants attending general medicine and neurology out - patient clinic appointments will be approached and enrolled into the study. baseline demographic details will be obtained and the questionnaire administered by a medicine resident in the local dialect. The 8 items qvsfs is going to be translated into three ( yoruba , hausa , chi ) different languages. We will evaluate the reliability of the translation before it is implemented to predict stroke status using a sample size of 50. Patients who score 0/8 will be deemed as stroke free whereas those with any positive score will be considered not stroke free.  participants will be recruited from five tertiary referral medical centers in west africa. ethical approval for the study will be sought from the ethics committees of the 5 participating sites. The original questionnaire developed by meschia et al will be translated into the local languages. Another version of the questionnaire will be developed where question items 3 to 8 will have line pictures of the neurological symptoms being elicited by the interviewer. activity , known heart disorders , family history of stroke will be assessed using 8 questions assessing knowledge of the presence of these specific risk factors. The first stage will involve a review of the medical records of patients to determine if a previous diagnosis of stroke has ever been made. The second stage entails an examination for presence of hemiparesis, hemi - anesthesia, mono - ocular / binocular visual loss, hemianopsia , receptive or expressive aphasia , and cerebellar deficits. The third stage will comprise of an evaluation of a cranial ct scan in a subset of participants. The sensitivity and specificity of the 6 stroke symptom questions will be determined for stroke diagnosis among patients with stroke. The accuracy and reliability of the 8-item qvsfs will be assessed in comparison with the benchmark stroke determination by history and examination by a neurologist. The performance of the questionnaire will be compared with neuro - imaging results in a small randomly selected subset.  qvsfs is a method for verifying stroke - free status in participants of clinical , epidemiological and genetic studies. The performance of this tool in settings where levels of education and awareness of stroke symptoms are low such as sub - saharan africa has not been conducted. The tool has tremendous potential for widespread use in regions such as ours.',\n",
       " 'ovarian mass represents a common problem in clinical practice. Of all gynecologic carcinoma , ovarian carcinoma represents the greatest clinical challenge. The majority of ovarian mass are benign ( 80% ) with cystic , solid , and mixed characteristics. The other 20% masses are malignant , so we need diagnostic means which permit accurate classification of ovarian masses before surgery. Sassone scoring system. applied . power and doppler flow imaging and spectral analysis were performed. results were recorded as being absent or present and further characterized as vessel location ( peripheral, central , and septal ) . on spectral dopplers , the lowest resistance index ( ri ) , and maximum peak systolic velocity ( psv ) detected at any point in the mass was used for analysis. Central vascularity and solid mass ( tubo - ovarian ) were responsible for false positivity. gray scale ultrasonography in combination with color doppler is proposed as the foremost diagnostic modality in patients with ovarian tumor. The goal is to establish the definite diagnosis of malignancy early in the course of the disease.',\n",
       " \"to convert a closed double - stranded dna or rna helix into two open single strands , so that other protein machinery can manipulate the polynucleotides , the cells require helicases. several dna and rna helicases have been isolated from all kingdoms of life , from virus to man. this enzyme is a promising target to develop new therapies and preventative agents. viruses belonging to families like flaviviridae, coronaviridae , and picornaviraceae cause clinically significant diseases in humans and animals. na viruses have been reported to encode the synthesis of a helicase. They might simply utilize helicases encoded by the host cell instead of their own proteins. All helicases bind ntp using two structurally common amino acidic sequences named motif i and motif ii. The atp - binding site of helicase is completed by an arginine finger and a catalytic base. The functional importance of helicases means that inhibitors or modulators for these enzymes are potentially important as therapeutic agents. Developing nontoxic helicase inhibitors as antiviral drugs is considerably more difficult than developing drugs designed to inhibit other viral enzymes. Many viral pathogens encode rna helicases which have been demonstrated essential for viral replication and pathogenesis. compounds that inhibit helicases via their atp - binding sites could have toxic effects on the host cells.  flaviviridae is a large family of related positive - strand rna viruses that currently consists of three genera : flavivirus, pestivirus and hepacivirus. within this family are comprised viruses that cause significant diseases in human and animal populations. some characteristics of helicase families of pathogen viruses belonging to flavivirs are reported in table 1 [ 9 , 10 , 34 ] Hepatitis c virus ( hcv) infects about 3% of the world 's population. The major causes of infection are use of unscreened blood transfusions and reuse of needles and syringes. pegylated interferon in combination with ribavirin is used in the clinic for hepatitis due to hcv.  competitive ntpase inhibitors may lead to decreased atpase activity and therefore to reduction of the unwinding rate. ribavirin 5-triphosphate ( rtp) inhibits the hcv nTPase / helicase by a competitive mechanism in regard to atp. The same behavior has been put in evidence for paclitaxel , compound structurally nonrelated to ntp. 4, 5, 6, 7-tetrabromobenzotriazole ( tbbt) ( 4) is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of protein kinase 2 , and 5,6-dichloro-1-(-d - ribofuranosyl ) benzotriAZole ( drbt ) ( 5) displayed ic50 values of 20 and 1.5  m , respectively ( figure 4 ) . on the contrary , the corresponding imidazole derivative of drbt ( drbi) showed very low activity. 1- or 2-alkyl benzotriazoles were screened for their effect on the hcv - helicase activity using the dna substrate. The authors observed that replacement of the alkyl side - chain by a substituent endowed with higher hydrophilicity could play a crucial role in the inhibition of the hCV ntpase / helicase. The same substituent in the position 1 of the 5,6-dichlorobenzotriazole drbt ( 5) was very effective in inhibiting the hcv and wnv helicases ( ic50 1.5  m and 3.0  m , respectively ) but ineffective against jev helicase. An additional class of nucleoside analogues known as ring - expanded nucleosides ( ren or fat) were reported to be active against the helicase unwinding reaction. Nucleosides 36 and 37 were synthesized by vorbrggen ribosylation of the respective heterocycles 35 and 38. Rens obtained with the above procedures were screened for inhibition of ntpase / helicase of the wnv. One of the most promising among these early inhibitors is 1-(2-o - methyl--d - ribofuranosyl)imidazo[4,5-d]pyridazine-4,7(5h,6h)-dione. Triphenylmethane derivatives have been identified as a good inhibitor that suppresses hcv rna replication. The most efficient was 3,5,7-tri[(30-methylpiperidin-10-yl)methyl]tropolone ( 64 ) with an ec50 of 35.6  m. pharma synthesized several benzimidazole derivatives. Two of them showed high activity against hcv helicase. The exact mechanism of 65 and 66 is still not clear. They might compete with nucleic acids in the manner above mentioned. The benzene ring and the nh group could interact by hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bound. A new selective inhibitor of the hcv helicase, qu663 ( compound 73 of figure 19 ) , discovered by maga and coworkers , showed a potent and selective inhibition with ki of 0.75  m. qu663 could function as a competitive inhibitor with respect to nucleic acid substrate by decreasing the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate. The predicted ( e)-methyl 4-((5-(3-oxobut-1-enyl)-1h - pyrrole-2-carboxamido)methyl)benzoate was synthesized and tested in the hCV replicon system. It inhibits hcv replicons with an ec50 of 9  m , but showing a cc50 = 30  m Two anthracycline derivatives, doxorubicin and nogalamycin, have been shown to be effective inhibitors of the unwinding reaction. The limits in their application for the treatment of chronic viral infections is their high cytotoxicity and weak penetration into the cell. If intercalative modulation of the dna or rna substrates is to be considered a possible antiviral therapy, less toxic and more selective derivatives must be identified. 5-methoxyacridone-4-carboxylic acids ( maca) were developed to improve the antiviral activity of acridones. Compound 81 came out not only as an efficient inhibitor of the ns3 helicase in the in vitro assay but also as a potent inhibitor of hcv replication endowed with low cytotoxicity for human hepatoma cells.  picornaviridae family includes 9 genera, 3 of which are human pathogens. All having a single - stranded positive - sense rna ( ssrna ) genome , cause a dramatic variety of illnesses. Two of them emerged for their selectivity : 87e , which was the most active against cvb-2.  n-[4-(1h(2h)-benzotriazol-1(2)-yl)phenyl]alkylcarboxamides ( 86a  e , g , h and 87a  g ) were prepared by condensation of the amino derivatives 90 , 91 with the appropriate anhydrides 92 under stirring at 100c for 2 h. The n-bis[4(1h)(2h)\\xa0phenyl)alkyldicarboxamide ( 88a  d ,  g ,  h  and  88a d89a g ) showed very selective activity against cvb-2 ( ec50 = 411  m ) resulting to be completely inactive against all the All the n , n-bis[4-(1h(2h)-benzotriazol-1(2)-yl)phenyl]alkyldicarboxamide derivatives bind helicase sb-1 in a different manner due to their different shapes and dimensions. The solvent accessible volume of this new class of inhibitors has almost doubled compared to that of the previous molecular series. The putative binding site proposed by carta and coworkers for sb-1 is composed by 30 residues. The binding site for cvb-2 differs for 7 residues only. The positively charged side chain of arg237 is placed at an average distance of 3.5   from the cl atoms.\",\n",

       " \"natural product research is a demanding science requiring an in - depth knowledge of many aspects of organic, analytical, and biological chemistry. Most contemporary practitioners would agree that the role of this discipline within biomedical science has declined. This review intends to stimulate discussion and inspire the development of new approaches to yield more rapid results. Purity plays a pivotal role in all pharmacopoeias worldwide. purity should never be ignored and always be part of quality control of drugs. The majority of pure nps represent rare chemicals of extremely limited supply. purity is important for the safety of medicines, but also exemplifies that purity should not be ignored.  compounds are also unique commodities and are only immediately available from a single source , namely , the original investigators or by re - isolation. Most pure nps compounds can be traced back ultimately to crude natural materials ( extracts ) that require various purification steps before being considered  pure.pure nps carry a natural signature in the form of a characteristic impurity profile called residual complexity. This review is based on the meta - analysis of the recent literature with a focus on parameters that reflect the analysis and purification of bioactive nps. Data have been extracted from nearly 2000 peer - reviewed articles. The methodology section describes the purification process used for isolated nps of controlled quality. The results of the study were based on a set of predefined parameters. The survey consisted of a large - volume screening  of reports from both years of period i and ii. It involved manual screening of 55  000 journal pages from 12 journals. Only 21 articles were assessed,  although about 80 articles would have fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Only one journal was assessed for the period 20002003 ( n = 77 ; not included in ntot ) Seven priority journals were selected due to their much higher information density. All articles were prescreened manually for the following inclusion criteria: they had to report on both bioactivity and chemistry of nps and provide a substantial experimental description. The raw data were collected into tabbed spreadsheets ( microsoft excel 2010 ) and analyzed using mathematical, boolean and other logics. All of the questions addressed under the observations made section of this review were also formulated at the onset of the study. While the insight gained during the study led to additional hypotheses that were eventually tested with the complete survey data. The scores initially implemented and keys as well as the basic set of questions were maintained constant during the entire study. The study included data collected on the spectroscopic characterization of the nps. Data included the number of compounds and the nature of the nmr data. Data was assessed and scored as \\xa0highly\\xa0comprehensive,\\xa0comprehensive, or lacking. The depth of the data was defined by the completeness and detail of interpretation. Each article in its entirety was mined for information about purity assessment of the bioactive nps. Data was encoded into binary format as a byte with five bits , as follows. All authors were involved in the data - mining process, which involved manual page turning of journal hard copies, judgment of inclusion of each article in the screened volumes. This study is an in - depth investigation of a handful of journals ( limited for practical reasons ) that publish articles routinely on the bioactivity of nps. seven of the 13 journals ( table 1) represent 79% coverage of qualifying reports. The articles assessed were almost evenly distributed over the time periods i, ii, and iii. )synthesis . the proportion of bioactive nps that were described as gifts from colleagues has dropped over the survey time period. The overall reduction in shared compounds might be a result of the trend toward smaller isolation yields and their consumption in the bioassays. The involvement of synthetic nps has seen a significant decline by 75% over the study period. Average proportions of purified nps across all journals rose from 78% to 93% in period i. The main reason for both the high proportion and the rise may be that the probability  of a major or even breakthrough discovery is lower with a compound  that has been extensively investigated due to its unrestricted ( commercial ) availability. The percentage of reports on new chemical entities has been remarkably stable over time. In the group a journals, an average of 30.1% of  reported nps were new chemical entity. In most cases the principal division of labor in the surveyed reports is the sharing of responsibilities between the chemist performing the isolation and the biologist completing the bioassay work. ification protocols . another measure of the importance of the biological component may be how many nps that produce promising hits in the biological assay are investigated further for their biological activity. The binary encoding and scoring of characteristics of the purification methods used in surveying all  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 reports is described in the methodology section. 22.9% of reports did not employ any isolation steps ( assigned value of 0) The other studies employed an average of three isolation steps. The data fit a gaussian normal distribution reasonably well ( figure s2 , supporting information ) , with a tail toward higher numbers. One conclusion from this data is that compounds that can be isolated in three steps or less are the predominantly isolated. The concentration of the nps in the crude material makes purification easier. The nature of the matrix components in crude nps may cause difficulties in the purification process. Some methods appear to work better than others for certain compound classes or types of source materials. There is little basis for judgment of the properties of these kinds of materials and its impact on the biological activity. Studies that use normal - phase silica gel report isolation of crystalline compounds 25 times more often than studies that do not use this sorbent. This may attest to the ability of normal-phase gel to concentrate and/or remove unwanted constituents and offer one reason for its steady popularity. Its widely known disadvantages such as irreversible absorption or degradation of desirable constituents are less frequently conveyed. The data show that a large proportion of isolation procedures are uniform rather than diverse. The most prevalent isolation methodology consists of normal - phase silica gel, gravity - driven column chromatography, and hplc. A chemically diverse metabolome likely requires a chromatographically diverse purification scheme for the efficient mining of nps. Survey also explored how widespread the use of this methodology is. In all studies and over the entire survey period, countercurrent methods such as hsccc are used only sporadically ( average 0.9% ) Despite recent developments of countercurrent technology, its proportional use in studies on bioactive nps has actually decreased. This systematic literature survey looked at only a limited number of journals. The use of normal - phase silica gel as a chromatographic method of choice is much more entrenched than can be simply explained by the fact that some alternatives are considered to be specialized techniques. While a few techniques have established themselves as mainstream , it remains unclear as to what other techniques have to offer and what  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 roles they can play in the future. The same coding scheme was applied to all publications and across the survey  time period. The distribution and average depth of spectroscopic information in the 13 surveyed journals were heterogeneous. The five group a journals showed an average score of 2.1 and covered greater than four - fifths ( 10  660 = 84.7% ) of all studied bioactive nps. Of the seven priority journals selected for long - term surveillance over the whole 19982010 period, five were group a journals. The distributions of the spectroscopic depth scores in the two journal groups are almost mirror images of each other. These results indicated that nmr spectroscopy in general and 2d - nmr , in particular , have become the mainstay of structure elucidation.  depth of nmr data can not be assessed in many cases simply because the spectra are not available. 2d nmr techniques generally reveal more structural subtleties than can typically be deduced from 1d h and c experiments only. purity reporting has been on a decline and was found in only 31 of 597 reports evaluated in the most recent period. Purity analysis was reported as being performed for less than 10 in 1000 compounds. The rate has been declining over the survey period ( 4.6% to 3.2% to 2.8% in periods i, ii, and iii ) This suggests that about 40% of reported purity information is taken from ( vendor ) labels or derived from undocumented or otherwise obscure methods. Purity, specificity, and complexity are involved in both the chemical and the biological portions of the analyses. The purity of nps used in bioassays is rarely reported. Recent developments in lc ( e.g. ,  uhplc ) and hyphenated technology have significantly advanced analytical capabilities. Purity evaluation using the 100% method is straightforward from most existing h nmr data sets. quantitative [ h ] nmr ( q[h]nmr ; see refs ( 30 , 31 ) for a literature overview ) so far has rarely been used for purity assessment. 40% of reported purities are taken from vendor labels or undocumented methods and an additional 30% from hplc statements. The rate of detailed purity assessment has declined to levels of 0.200. Of the total number of bioactive nps ( ncpd = 12  570 ) , an average of seven compounds ( sd 7 ) were included in one report. 85% of purity statements contained one single value rather than a range of purities, indicating that only one or very few nps were analyzed and/or individual samples were not differentiated. Three additional dimensions of complexity affect the interpretation of research data. Nps in bioassays that comprise different response elements ( biome) can be symbolized by triangles. triangles represent both the well - defined target ( t ) of the bioassay and the residual complexity ( rc) of the nps. Figure 3 shows that, depending on the combination of these factors, observations from the lack of bioactivity to the presence of strong activity potentially can be explained for nps that otherwise appear to be identical or at least comparable. Purity of ursolic acid ( purity  activity  relationships ) has led to the routine integration of qhnmr purity assessment in the authors' laboratory. Recent articles provide convincing evidence for the relevance of higher plants and other terrestrial organisms as sources for new bioactive lead compounds. The purification of highly active principles that are minor constituents likely requires more effort.  Structure elucidation is an asymptotic process and can be compared with a balancing act between the interpretation of the spectroscopic data and the possible structural variations that can potentially be aligned with it. The authors make a convincing case by employing detailed density functional theory and h nmr analysis. The first cyanogenic glycoside with -allose rather than -glucose attached to the cyanogenic methine carbon has broad implications for the enzymology of cyanogenesis. h nmr spectral simulation and involved a detailed analysis of the higher order j coupling patterns of the sugar moiety.  metabolomics absolutely requires an organized investigation of the thousands of chemical entities that a single organism may contain. The depth of the spectroscopic data and the thoroughness of their reporting represent important parameters of the integrity in nps research. Future meta - analyses of the nps literature can likely benefit from extended parameter sets that enable addressing additional aspects of bioactive nps. High purity certainly has its merit , because it allows the np to approach sce status and simplifies the interpretation and understanding of a biological outcome. However, requiring nps to be highly pure often imposes overly proportional or even unrealistic efforts and costs on the research. Even less pure materials can be potentially useful and/or are suitable as unique research tools for biological studies.\",\n",
       " \"we examined parasite clearance kinetics and sequenced the parasite k13 gene in a cohort of 78 children with severe malaria. The patients were treated intravenously with artesunate ( guilin pharmaceutical , shanghai , china ) prequalified by the world health organization. The median age of patients was 2.0 years ( range 1.08.0 to 2.00 years ) , and 38 ( 49% ) were female. We identified limited diversity within the k13 gene. We did not observe any of the most common amino acid substitutions in k13 associated with artemisinin resistance in p. falciparum isolates from cambodia. A previously reported point mutation , a578s ( 9,15 ) , was found in 3 ( 3.8% ) of 78 infections. The role of the a578s amino acid substitution is unclear , but it occurs near the most common k13-propeller mutation ( c580y ) The a578S mutation has been associated with delayed parasite clearance in southeast asia and with tolerance to artemisinin in vitro ( 3) computational modeling suggests that a578's should considerably affect the tertiary structure of the k13 protein.\",\n",
       " 'in 2013, about 973 million people sustained injuries that warranted some type of healthcare globally. Non - fatal injuries cause 36.8 million years lived with disability ( yld ) accounting for 14.8% of injury - induced disability adjusted life years ( dalys) accurate statistics concerning non - fatal conditions are critical to valid calculation of the burden of injury. Survey included interviews with adults in the household who were home at the time of the survey. For children ( under age 15 ) and household adults not home, parents or other adult family members answered on their behalf. We divided household income equally into four categories based on the household income per capita in the last year for urban and rural areas. When the complex sample design ( sampling weight ) is considered , the confidence interval can be significantly wider than may be expected. We conducted poisson regression to detect differences in prevalence rates by urban vs. rural setting, sex, age group and household income per capita. All procedures were reviewed and approved by the medical ethics committee of central south university , changsha , china.  injury prevalence rates over the past 2 weeks were calculated as number of injuries divided by total number of respondents. sampling weights ( the multiplicative inverse of respondents probability of being selected , w=1 ) were applied to correct unequal probabilities of being chosen. Poisson regression with robust estimates is suggested as an alternative to control for overestimation of errors in binomial data for cross - sectional studies. Households with the lowest and low per capita household income were at higher risk of suffering injuries compared to those from households with the highest per capita income. Table 1 shows the 2-week prevalence of non - fatal injuries in hunan province, china, in 2013. The data were adjusted for setting, sex, age group and household income per capita. Household income per capita was equally classified into four categories based on quartiles.

       " \" irreversible electroporation ( ire) is a nonthermal technique which utilizes electrical pulses to destroy cells. ire has been shown to have good efficacy and safety in the management of patients with lapc. The potential for improved survival rates has been reported in patients treated with ire ablation combined with chemotherapy and/or chemoradiation therapy. ocal or concerning for recurrence , a ct - pet scan was obtained for confirmation of the patient 's current disease status. A three - phase ct scan was performed less than 7 days before ire and after induction chemotherapy to ensure the persistence of locally advanced pancreatic cancer. A repeat ultrasound with power doppler is performed to confirm preserved flow and patency to the vital structures. Triphasic ct scan is the most consistent , most reliable way to image this unique subset of patients who were treated with ire. post - ire imaging of the pancreas has been reported to be quite challenging due to the acute inflammatory changes seen from the first through tenth postoperative day. Ablation success was defined as the ability to deliver the intraoperative therapy and within 3 months to have no evidence of macroscopic tumor. Local recurrence after ablation most often presents as new tissue in the periphery of the treated lesion and/or apparent enlargement of the ablation defect. An amorphous , hypoattenuating region with irregular shape persisted in subsequent ct scans in all patients with  stable disease. The immediate postablation bed and zone are invariably larger than the original ablated tumor. All stage pancreatic cancers are not surrounded by normal pancreatic parenchyma and the retroperitoneal tissue, surrounding vessels , and duodenum all create variability on imaging. The postablation bed and zone appear irregular and hazy without margins or true boundaries. Any increase in volume after stabilization is considered worrisome for recurrence. The efficacy of the ablative therapy relies only on imaging characteristics. There is no way to prove by imaging whether or not small volume disease remains at the ablation bed. What we can not see through imaging can not be treated. We conclude that ct imaging may be a useful tool to assess post - ire ablation changes.\",\n",
       " 'anti - retroviral therapy ( art) has improved the quality of life of human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) patients worldwide. A reduction in hiv - related morbidity and mortality has been recognized in countries where art has been made widely available. To achieve optimal results from art, high levels of patient adherence to art is essential. A facility based cross - sectional study was carried out among 116 people living with hiv ( plhiv ) on art. The study subjects were adult patients ( aged 18 years or above ) on first line anti - retroviral treatment. 72.41% of the patients in our study received free art provided by the government. A p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Of the 116 participants in our study, 42 ( 36% ) patients reported adherence of < 95%. financial constraints , forgetting to take medication , lack of family care , depression , alcohol use , social stigma , and side effects to art were associated with low adherence. adherence is a major issue in management of chronic diseases. in a meta - analysis of 569 studies , 24.8% of subjects were non - adherent. Self - reporting is the most commonly used measure of adherence in resource limited settings because it is easy to include in routine clinical practice. alcohol use, drug side effects, depression , stigma and lack of family support are factors associated with reduced adherence. busy medical practitioners must find sufficient time for counseling , which is very essential for the success of art program in our country.',\n",
       " \"Malaria is still an endemic disease in certain foci located in south and southeast of iran. Organophosphate compounds are the most common chemical larvicides which are used in control of anopheles. citrus aurantium linnaeus ( rutaceae) is used as a condiment in iran for marmalade. dried whole fruit is used in asian and western herbal medicine to treat digestive problems. Citrus paradisi macfadyen ( rutaceae ) or grapefruit contains many phytochemicals which contribute to a healthy diet. It is used in persian traditional medicine to treat infected injuries , some digestive problems , cold and helps to lower cholesterol. The objective of this work was to study the effect of the peel essential oils of ripe fruits of c. aurantium and c. paradisi against fourth instar larvae. Anopheles stephensi were obtained from laboratory culture of department of medical entomology , tehran university medical sciences ( tums ) The anopheles colony was maintained at 27 c with 12 : 12 light and dark photoperiod in 6010% relative humidity. The essential oils do not dissolve in water ethanol 99.0% was used as co - solvent. Toxicity and activity were reported as lc 50 and lc90 , representing the concentrations in ppm that killed 50% and 90% , respectively of larvae in 24 h. 24 h of exposure while during the test no food was given to the larvae. controls with mortality between 520% were corrected using abbott 's formula ( abbott 1925 ) when mortality in controls exceeded 20% , test results were rejected or repeated. comparison of the lc50 and lC90 values were analyzed using anova test with spss version 17.0.  quantitative data were obtained from the electronic integration of the flame ionization detector ( fid ) peak areas. identification of the oil components were assigned based on retention indices which were calculated by using retention times of n - alkanes that were injected after the oil at the same chromatographic conditions. compounds were identified by comparison of their relative retention indices and with those in the literature. The lc50 and lc90 values of c. aurantium and c. paradisi oils against anopheles stephensi larvae were 31.20 ppm and 73.83 ppm , 35.71 ppm and 70.23 respectively. Both peels essential oils at the 80 ppm concentrations killed more than 90% of the fourth instars larvae. The mortality rates in the control groups were lower than 5% in all concentrations. Both peels essential oils at the 80 ppm concentrations killed more than 90% of the fourth instars larvae. mortality rates in the control groups were lower than 5% in all concentrations. No significant statistical difference in mortality rate among two essential oils ( p 0.628 ) Larval bioassay tests showed that essential oils of c. aurantium and c. paradise have a same level of bioactivity against an . stephensi larvae. The lc50 of the essential oil of the citrus was 47.3 ppm and 85.1 ppm for ae . albopictus. Limonene of peel essential oil of c. aurantium is promising as larvicide and could be useful in the search for new natural larvicidal compounds. malaria in indo - persian areas including southern areas of iran . the results obtained from this study suggest that the limonene is promising.\",\n",
       " 'chemical senses during a meal are a cue to recognize food ingestion and to determine its composition of nutrients. attention is focused on visual sense , texture , olfaction and taste during the meals. The concentration of each amino acid in the blood as well as the brain are metabolically controlled within certain limits all day long. u is present in most organs and tissues ( skeletal muscles, brain, kidneys, and liver ) in substantial concentrations. In the brain , glu acts as a major excitatory neurotransmitter. Glu in foods elicits a unique taste termed umami taste, which is generally thought to be a signal for dietary protein ingestion in the brain. The role of saliva is not only to lubricate food for mastication and swallowing but also to initiate the digestion of nutrients. Sweet taste stimulation with sucrose and glucose in iso - tonic solution increases the efferent activity of the pancreatic and the hepatic vagus nerves in rats. A very salty taste solution containing a high concentration of nacl suppresses such activity because of aversive foods stimuli. In the gastrointestinal ( gi ) tract, various nutrients are detected and absorbed through the luminal layer. nutrients also regulate the activity of vagal afferent nerves and the release of gi peptides. Among the 20 kinds of amino acids , glu alone stimulates the nerve end of rat vga. % of 5-ht throughout the body is concentrated and localized in the enterochromaffin ( ec ) cells of the gi mucosa. ec cells serve a paracrine function by specifically recognizing glu in the lumen of the stomach. This is similar to the physiological role , as reported in the duodenal glucose sensing system. Inosine 5-monophosphate also activates vga and increases vagal celiac efferent activity. These findings suggest that a specific glu - sensing system in the stomach could contribute to the gastric phase of protein digestion and could integrate nutrient information in the brain by vagal afferent excitation.  intraintestinal infusion of msg , lysine , leucine , and other amino acids evoked excitatory responses in vca. In contrast to the responses in these amino acids , the same treatment with glycine , methionine and certain other amino acid led to the depression of afferent nerve activity. In addition to autonomic reflexes , the effects of ingested nutrients in the alimentary tracts are processed in the forebrain. An intragastric intubation of 60  mm glucose and an equimolar nacl solution have been shown to activate distinct forebrain regions. glu signaling during digestion processes may enhance thermogenesis and force excessive intake of every source from an experimental diet to be cured as energy expenditure. T - map images ( bregma + 2.0) depict activated brain regions at pre - administration ( 5  min ) and 10 , 20 , and 40  min after the onset of intragastric infusion. The anterior cingulate cortex, insular cortex, amygdala, caudate - putamen, hippocampus , and the lateral hypothalamus are commonly activated. These regions should be related to cfp. Fig. 4mean intake of conditioned stimulus ( filled bar cs+ , flavored water with intragastric infusion of msg , nacl , or glucose ) solutions in the pre - test and test periods. mean percent intakes of the cs+ solution are shown above the bars . reproduced from uematsu et al. Ingested food is digested and absorbed in free form as small molecular nutrients in the gi tract. The afferent vagus nerve is activated by each of these free form nutrients during digestion processes. Glp-1 and cck evoke c - fos positive immunoreactivity in several brain regions, including the amygdala.  vagotomy diminished glu - induced activation in the nts and the hypothalamus , whereas total vagotomy did not affect glucose - induced brain activation. The spatial and temporal patterns of brain activation could link with postingestive behavioral and physiological effects underlying the maintenance of homeostasis following a meal. The capacity of biosynthesis of free glutamate is immature in infants and retarded in the elderly. let growth is to be retarded . from the point of digestive physiology , switching from a milk formula to a solid diet as described above , glu has a potential for the intestine to release mucin due to establishment of a barriers system against microbiota. Therefore, supplementation liquid for weaning piglets containing glu and l - glutamine ( gln ) as a precursor for glu results in a significant improvement of the diarrhea index and their state of nutrition. Dietary glu influences numerous physiological functions, suggesting a broad, integrative role for dietary glu in body homeostasis. This newly developed method for brain functional change observation in well - trained awake rats using a fmri was recently confirmed by c - fos expression in similar rats.',\n",
       " 'viruses and cells : the 766 bvdv isolates were kindly provided from 14 livestock hygiene service centers in hokkaido prefecture , japan from 2006 to 2014. These viruses were isolated from serum, buffy coat, nasal discharge, pleural effusion, fecal specimen or emulsion of an organ ( lung, liver, kidney, spleen , heart or brain ) of cattle or aborted fetuses infected with bvdvs. The bovine kidney cell line mdbk - hs  was propagated in eagle s minimum essential  essential medium ( nissui pharmaceutical , tokyo ) supplemented with 0.295% tryptose phosphate  and 10% horse serum. 20 passages were propagated in mem - bes with 5% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum which is free from both bvdv antigens and antibodies. The 5-utr genome was amplified by reverse transcription ( rt ) and pcr using the superscript iii one - step rt - pcr system. The entire e2 gene of bvdvs was amplified using primers  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 in supplementary table 1 and ex - taq dna polymerase ( takara bio ) nucleotide sequences of pcr fragments were determined using the bigdye terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit. Fisher s exact test was performed in order to identify the categories responsible for a significant chi - square statistic. rabbit antisera against the nose strain ( bvdv-1a ) and the kz-91-ncp strain (bvdv -2a ) were also produced by four times injection. Cross - neutralization tests were performed in bfm cell cultures grown in 96-well microplates as described previously. 766 bvdvs were isolated from 2006 to 2014 from pi cattle in hokkaido, japan. The proportion of subgenotypes 1a, 1b, 1c and 2a was 12.1% , 48.4% , 10.5% and 29.0% , respectively. The sequence identity of the 5-utr was 7275% between bvdv-1 and  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0bvdv\\xa02 isolates. Cattle infected with bvdv-1b viruses showed significantly less clinical signs compared with other subgenotypes. Clinical signs frequently observed in cattle were poor development, diarrhea, respiratory symptoms, reproductive failure, fever, mucosal disease and death. phylogenetic analysis on the basis of nucleotide sequences of the viral  glycoprotein e2 gene was carried out on the bvdV-1a, 1b and 2a isolates in hokkaido. phylogenetic tree of bvdv-1a field isolates based on nucleotide sequences of the  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 entire e2 gene. nucleotides 1,122 bp of the entire e1 gene were used for phylogenic analysis. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the maximum - likelihood method and bootstrap analysis ( n=1,000 ) by the mega 6.0 software. The classification of each e2 cluster of bvdv-1a and 1b  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 was not biased by year and geographical localization of viral isolation. Only isolates of  2009 and 2010 years were classified as bvdV-2a cluster ii. The 38 field isolates  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 in hokkaido wereclassified as 5 clusters ( i  v ) followed by bootstrap values of  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 phylogenetic analysis. 8    isolates of bvdv-1a and 10  \\xa0isolates of  bvdV-1b were randomly selected from each e2 cluster for cross - neutralization tests. The cross -neutralization tests showed 4 to 64-fold antigenic differences between bvd v- 1a and 1b isolates in japan. neutralization titers are expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution that inhibits 50% viral growth. bvdv/ is  omitted from the name of field isolates. antigenic similarity ( r ) values of bvdV-1a and 1b strains were 6.3 to 17.7, which suggested significant antigenic differences. The 6 isolates of bvdv-2a were also selected for antigenic analysis by cross - neutralization tests based on the same criteria. rabbit antisera against  hamanaka/843/10 strain were prepared to analyze antigenic property of\\xa0bvdv\\xa02a cluster ii. The r values among subgenotypes were 12.5 to 35.4 , and significant antigenic differences were not observed among bvdV-2 subgenotype.  bvdvs have been detected since 1969 in japan , and bvd has not been eradicated as yet. approximately 60% of dairy cattle and 20% of beef cattle in a total of japan are raised in the hokkaido prefecture. to confirm a diagnosis of persistent infection, cattle should be retested after an interval of at least 3 weeks. Most of cattle were not retested because of economic losses by detention of viral pollutant in herds. Bvdv-1b and 2a viruses were predominant recently in hokkaido, japan. The predominance of bvdv -1b may be due to the difficulty of diagnosis by clinical signs. The e2 is a main target of immune responses in hosts and important for viral antigenicity.  bvdv-1a, 1b and 2a isolates are likely to be antigenically conserved among each subgenotype during the last 14 years in hokkaido, japan. In contrast, bvd v-1b viruses were recently predominant in other countries, such as switzerland and argentina. It is still unclear whether the predominant situation of bvdV-1B viruses in japan was due to vaccine pressure or not. Bvdv-1a, 1b and 2a isolates show genetic diversity on the e2 gene with antigenic  conservation among each subgenotype during the last 14 years. Based on the present study, it is required to use effective vaccine against predominant field isolates for the control of bvd in Japan.',\n",

       " ' osa is characterized by recurrent obstructions of the upper airway during sleep. This repeated hypoxia and reoxygenation cycle initiates oxidative stress. Osa is associated with increased levels of oxidative stress markers or decreased antioxidant defence. We measured levels of soluble receptor for advanced glycation end - products ( srage) and high sensitive c - reactive protein ( hscrp) Mmp-2 and mmp-9 are involved in degradation of collagen type iv , elastin and fibronectin. ros have been shown to regulate the levels of mmps in various cellular and in vivo systems. increase in mmps activity was shown to be associated with the progression of atherosclerotic plaques to their rupture. In the morning after polygraphy, fasting venous blood samples were taken. selected markers were measured : hscrp , papp - a , mmp-2 , mMP-9 , srage , cu , zn. The group comparisons were performed with one - way parametric anova. multiple regression was used to obtain and compare the effects of individual predictors. Adult men with suspicion of osa indicated for nocturnal polygraphy in the sleep laboratory were enrolled in the study. excluded from the study were patients with the following diseases: stroke or cerebral injury less than 6 month before the study, major cardiological diseases including cardiac insufficiency and manifest coronary artery disease, pulmonary hypertension and patients with diabetes mellitus treated with insulin. Body mass index ( bmi) and ventilation parameters were correlated to chosen oxidative stress - related markers for the whole group of patients independent of osa intensity. We found strong correlations between bmi and levels of mmp-9, cu and hscr. positive correlation for cu was found only with odi. significant negative correlations were found for spo2. further used standard laboratory methods to measure blood count, minerals, renal function, liver enzymes, lipids and glycemia. Oxidative stress is a condition resulting from an imbalance between the prooxidative state and the antioxidant defence. This study was designed to assess the impact of osa on novel parameters related to oxidative stress. In our study higher bmi is associated with increased oxidative stress , independently of other parameters such as osa . we found strong positive correlation between bmi and osa. The strongest correlation was demonstrated for mmp-9 , hscrp and cu and parameters of osa ( especially odi and spo2 ) in our study. We suggest that odi is a stronger predictor of oxidative stress level than is ahi. obesity seems to be primary risk factor of the increased oxidative stress state.  soluble rage ( srage ) is a naturally occurring inhibitor of age - rage action. osa is an independent risk factor in obesity for increased oxidative stress state as shown by diminishing of some oxidative stress - related markers after cpap therapy. We found that srage level is associated with ahi , odi and also negatively associated with bmi.',\n",

The period between 7 and 11 day of gestation marked the time of organogenesis which is the period when fetuses are more susceptible to teratogenic agents. It has been noted by cyril that drugs may pass through the placental barrier and damage the fetus because the pharmacological effects are enhanced. The enzyme systems responsible for the degradation are undeveloped in the fetus. Administration of ethanolic leaf and root bark extracts of rauwolfia vomitoria on the 7 through 11 day of gestation may be cardiotoxic.',\n",

More than one hundred compounds were determined in total in all the mushroom species investigated. The highest number of identified compounds was found in the species t. rutilans and a. xanthodermus. lactarius deliciosus and lactarius chrysorrheus have quite similar morphological features. Gc analysis highlighted noticeable differences between l. deliciosus and l. chrysorrheus. When chopped or injured, a. aegerita smells like wine and acidic. Some lethal accidents have been registered for ingestion of omphalotus olearius. Clathrus ruber and ganoderma resinaceum were the last two species of wild mushrooms under investigation. The fruiting body of c. ruber has the shape of a round ball composed of interlaced branches. The branches are spongy , red , pink , or orange , with a slime on their inner surfaces. This mushroom emits a foul , corpse - like , and pungent smell , which acts as attractant for flies to spread the mushroom spores. atic alcohols and ketones, typically characterized by 8 carbon atoms skeleton, were determined. compounds with aromatic ring were determined at considerable amounts, such as benzaldehyde and benzyl alcohol. During spme method development , two different fiber coatings were tested , namely , dvb / car / pdms ( 50/30  m ) and pDms / dvB ( 65  m) The triple phase showed scarce linearity compared to the pdm / dVb phase. 1-octen-3-ol was indiscriminately used for all the volatiles extracted , sulphur compounds included. The internal standard method is mostly advised for simpler matrices. The method was validated in terms of linearity, limits of detection , limits of quantification , recovery , and repeatability. 10 different varieties of mushrooms from the wild have been analyzed for the determination of their volatile fingerprints by means of spme - gc - ms. Once again, eight - carbon molecules have demonstrated to be key compounds in these organisms ' volatile fraction. Their formation seems to involve a unique fungal biochemical pathway , reported in literature as strictly connected to lipid and fatty acid metabolism. A. bisporus cultivated mushrooms are a highly perishable food. knowledge of storage modifications can improve the technology for preserving their sensory and texture qualities over time. A. Bisporus is the most common mushroom that can be found in the vegetable counter of a supermarket. It seems useful to exploit the potential of spme to detect which kind of biochemical modifications occur in the mushrooms.\",\n",
       " \"kidney cancer is the 3 most common urological malignancy and is expected to account for % 3 of all cancer related deaths. Historically, standard treatment for the renal masses of all sizes was radical nephrectomy. more recently, robot - assisted partial neph rectomy ( rapn) was introduced as a minimally invasive alternative to open and lpn. rapn has significant advantages over conventional laparoscopy. omerular filtration rates ( egfr ) calculated with the modification of diet and renal disease formula were compared with the postoperative creatinine and egfr levels. tumors that were excised under cold ischemia using ice slush were excluded. All statistical analyses were performed using spss statistics version 20 ( ibm , armonk , ny , usa ) software. Tumor bed was sutured continuously with a v - loc suture to stop the bleeders and approximate the renal parenchyma. The defect was then covered with hemostatic agent ( floseal , baxter , inc . , irvine , ca , usa ) and renal paretchyma was further approximated using a 0 - 0 polyglactin suture on a ct-1 needle with sliding - clip renorrhaphy technique. All patients received comprehensive metabolic panel every 6 months for 2 years and then yearly.  renal tumor was excised with adequate surgical margin of the renal parenchyma using cold scissors. tumor bed was sutured continuously with a v - loc suture to stop the bleeders and approximate the renal Parenchymal repair. renal parechyma was further approximated using 0 - 0 polyglactin sutures on ct-1 needle with sliding - clip renorrhaphy technique. all patients received comprehensive metabolic panel every 6 months for 2 years and then yearly. There were no statistically differences in preoperative serum creatinine , egfr , and hematocrit values between two groups. The mean operative time was 152 ( 18 ) min in opn group and 225 ( 58) min in rapn group. mean tumor size was 4.04 ( range = 212 ) cm in opN group and 3.56 ( 1.7 - 7) cm in rapN group ( p = 0.27 ) . mean r.e.n.a.l nephrometry score was 6.35 (1.7 , range = 4 - 10 ) in op n group. Robotic surgical system has been introduced in order to reduce limitations associated with conventional laparoscopy. mean operation time was significantly longer in patients who underwent rapn. rapn has better outcomes in terms of ebl when compared with an open group. length of hospital stay and drain removal time were significantly shorter in rapn group. In another study, lee et al. reported to comparative analyses of rapn versus opn. they concluded that rapn offered acceptable perioperative outcomes compared to open surgery. In another study , the mean operation time was longer in a robotic group ( 192 vs. 142 min ) while there was no significant difference in ebl.  rapn is a safe and effective minimally invasive alternative to opn in terms of oncologic outcomes. malignant pathology was found in % 70 of opn patients and % 80.4 in rapn patients. No local recurrence occurred in both groups in the follow-up. cological and functional outcomes .. The effects of the treatment on the body can be seen in a number of different ways.

       " \"malaria is a major tropical disease for which no long - term sustainable treatment is available. In 2015 alone, 214 million cases were reported globally resulting in an estimated 438,000 deaths. In recent years parasite resistance against artemisinin and its derivatives has emerged and spread along the cambodia - thailand border. There are only a few examples of the -amino alcohol moiety reported in the last thirteen years. We explored the structure - activity relationship of 1-aryl-3-susbtituted propanol derivatives with promising results. Further studies on the unexplored -moiety as a source of new antimalarial drugs are needed. Low parasitemia reduction ( 65% ) was observed in the in  vivo plasmodium berghei mouse model. linker reduction in one carbon atom between the alcohol and amine portion ( -to  - amino alcohol ) in apd reduced the activity by half. More studies with apd are necessary to be validated as potential antimalarial hits. All methyl ketone precursors ( v ) were commercially available. Ketone intermediates ( -amino ketones ) ( 113) were prepared by condensation of the corresponding methyl ketones with the different aryl amines ( iv ) via mannich reaction. The hydroxyl derivatives ( -Amino alcohols ) ( 1426) were obtained by reduction of the. corresponding carbonyl group with nabh4 in methanol ( scheme 2) Hplc experiments were developed on an ultimate 3000 chromatograph ( dionex ) with chromeleon v.6.8 software. The retention times ( tr ) are expressed in minutes and the reference wavelength is set at 254  nm. compounds ii and iii were synthesized as previously described. The organic phase was dried with anhydrous na2so4 and filtered. ating the solvent to dryness under reduced pressure. purified by column chromatography ( sp : silica gel ) eluting with dcm / meoh 99:1 ( v / v ) or automated flash chromatography. selected compounds were converted to hydrochloride salts by adding a hydrogen chloride ethereal solution to the stirred compounds.

The multidrug resistant fcr-3 strain of p.\\xa0fascia was cultured at 37  c in a pure gas mixture of 5% o2 , 5% co2 , and 90% n2 environment. compounds were dissolved in dmso and tested with final concentrations ranging between 0.1 and 200  m. The classical 4-day suppressive test was carried out as follows. swiss male mice weighing 20    2  g were infected with 10   berghei anka parasitized cells ( day 0) Two hours after infection and at the same time during 4 consecutive days, batches of three to five mice were orally treated at a dose of 50  mg / kg / day. Human intestinal absorption ( % abs) was calculated using the following approach of zhao et  al . ( 2002):%abs  = 109  (0.345    tpsa ) the sos / umu test was used to determine the dna - damaging effect. The test strain salmonella typhimurium ta1535/psk1002 ( german collection for microorganisms and cell cultures ( dsmz) was thawed from stock ( 80  c ; in tga medium containing 10% dmso as cryoprotective agent ) In case where cell survival was < 80% in the lowest concentration tested, new 11 serial  dilutions at lower concentrations were prepared. The highest concentrations of dmso used for the positive controls were 100  g / ml for 4-nqo ( final concentration : 2.5  g  / ml ) and 0.0125  mg / ml  for 2-aa. After the incubation period , the od600 was measured in order to evaluate toxicity on s.  typhimurium ta1535/psk1002. Galactosidase relative units were calculated for both positive controls and the test was only considered valid if the positive controls reached an induction factor 2 under the given test conditions. A compound was considered genotoxic when in any of the conditions studied ( with or without metabolic activation ) the if of the umu operon was 2 at non - cytotoxic concentrations. D6 and c235 strains were sorbitol synchronized to the ring stage. Parasites were lysed with 10  mm edta, 100  mm tris - hcl ( ph 7.5 ) , 0.16% ( w / v ) saponin , and 1.6% ( v / v) triton x-100. fluorescence was read using a synergy h4 hybrid plate reader ( biotek) metasite software 3.0.4 ( molecular discovery ltd . ) was used to predict human liver metabolism ( site of metabolism ) and potential metabolites.  pm2 ( 200  nm ) was preincubated for 5  min in 0.1  m sodium formate , ph 4.4. compounds dissolved in 100% dmso were added to the enzyme for a final concentration of 5  m. substrate cleavage reaction was monitored by the decrease in the average absorbance from 284 to 324  nm on a cary 50 bio varian spectrophotometer. The compound 's ability to affect the hemozoin formation pathway as a drug target was validated with the heme speciation assay ( combrinck et  al . , 2015 ) A d6 culture was sorbitol synchronized to the early ring stage and diluted to 5% parasitemia and 2% hematocrit. The mature parasites were then isolated from the erythrocytes through selective lysis with saponin. All molecules used in the pharmacophore study were drawn using chemdraw ultra software 7.0 ( cambridgesoft ltd . ) with stereoisomerism manually checked. then, structures were submitted to ligandscout as smiles. For the classical arylamino alcohols ( caa ) , a consensus model was generated using the four molecules ( quinine , mefloquine , lumefantrine , and halofantrine ) and respective stereoisomers. Chiral separation of compound 25 was made using ultra performance convergence chromatography with a chiralpack ic column ( supplementary data fig .  1 ) There were no significant potency differences between the compound 25 enantiomers and racemic mixture against p.  falciparum f32 tanzania , chloroquine sensitive strain ( f32 ic50    0.50  m ) Overall, incorporation of a single fluorine atom in the ar ( hydrophobic ) region provided potency across the different benzo[b]thiophene , naphthalene , and benzene derivatives. -1-naphthyl derivatives are 5-fold more active than 5-fluorobenzo[b]thiophenyl analogues ( 18 vs 22 ) and 1- to 3-foldMore active than 4 fluoro-1\\xa0phenyl analogs ( 23 vs 26 and 22 vs 25) The cytotoxicity of the thirteen newly synthesized hydroxyl analogues ( 1426) was determined against vero cells. The most active compounds ( 22, 23, 24, and 25) showed moderate to high degree of selectivity index. Topological polar surface area ( tpsa) is a good descriptor of drug absorbance in the intestines. The oral bioavailability of hydroxyl analogues could be considered interesting as agents for antimalarial therapy. studies to analyze the dna - damaging effect or genotoxicity of the most active compounds were performed. The nitro substituent often causes safety concerns due to its well - documented mutagenic and carcinogenic potential.  compounds 22, 23, and 25 showed potent antimalarial activity in both strains of p.  falciparum. compounds 24 was inferior in terms of in  vivo parasitemia reduction ( 17    8% ; msd  =  8) Compound 25 was less active against the multidrug resistant strain ( d6 ic50  = 0.49  m , c235 ic50 =  0.28  m)  intermediates of the most active compounds ( 22, 23, and 25) were tested against p.  falciparum fcr-3 chloroquine resistant strain. intermediates am01 and am02 showed low antiplasmodial activity compared to their final products. metasite predicted the p450 2c9- , p450 3a4- , and p 450 2d6-catalyzed n - dealkylation of 22,23, and25 as potential metabolites. N - dealkylation would occur principally on the side chain -carbon hydrogen(s) next to the amino aliphatic nitrogen for 22 and 25. The viability to find an intermediate as a product of cyp biotransformation exists. Eight compounds synthesized in this manuscript with antiplasmodial compounds showed no significant inhibition of pm2 compared to the control.  apd could be useful for the antimalarial drug discovery community as decoys or negative controls for in silico high - throughput screening campaigns to identify pm2 inhibitors. The ic50 values reported by friedman and caflish ( 2009 ) for the 11 arylamino alcohols are considered medium to low when compared with other well - known plasmepsin inhibitors ( ic50    0.01  m) Only compound 22 was found to inhibit -hematin formation with an ic50 of 80.7    1.7 m ( table  4 ) The affinity of compound 22 for the -oxo dimer form of heme was shown through a binding curve with 22. Despite a decline in parasite viability with increasing concentrations of compound , the levels of free heme and hemozoin remained constant. oquine , lumefantrine , and halofantrine ) using 3d pharmacophore models. The common features are observed in the hydrophobic ( naphthyl and phenyl system ) and the amine region of the scaffold. However, apd exhibited nine differences in comparison with caa ( two hpf , one arf , and six hbaf ) Only a 40% (6/15) of similarity between apd and caa was observed at the pharmacophore level. differences may explain the lack of inhibition with the pm2 enzyme and hemozoin pathway. compounds 22 and 23 showed potent antimalarial activity in chloroquine sensitive and multidrug resistant strains. old must be done through complementary sar , mechanistic , and pharmacology studies.

       " \"This study explores how evolutionary genetics might help inform modern cattle breeding programmes and shows some examples from tropically adapted cattle. We consider the importance of environmental stress for identifying robust genotypes in production systems. The evolutionary path of cattle since domestication provides insight into the current fitness levels as well as a better understanding of the interactions between cattle genotypes , environments and management intervention strategies. Cattle have undergone a rapid recent decrease in effective population size from a very large ancestral population. Any future proposal for evolutionary management of cattle domestication should consider this worldwide structure of the breeds. The evolution of the adaptaur under tropical stress provides a model approach to cattle breeding. If applied within the broader livestock industries might determine more favourable genotypes. We provide perspectives on g  e  m and how this could contribute to evolution of future strains or breeds of cattle. The implications relate to: ( i) fitting the right genotypes to the right environments and production systems and ( ii) determining the optimal genotype across a range of environments. The senepol is a two - breed composite of n'dama and red poll cattle bred on the caribbean island of st croix in 1918. modern genetic selection programmes are capable of delivering cumulative gains of 12% per annum for the trait ( or combination of traits ) under selection. quantitative genetic methods have been a crucial component of productivism. Research and breeding programmes of dairy cattle have started to shift emphasis from production - only traits in the breeding goal to traits that are associated with robustness and sustainability. beef cattle breed societies have gone down a similar path to the dairy industries with the emphasis on performance recording production traits. In beef cattle breeding, growth , calving ease , reproduction and meat quality traits such as muscle and/or fat depth and tenderness are the main drivers of commercial operations. Inbreeding is posing additional problems for the intensive cattle industries. Inbreeding can lead to loss of fitness and even survival of a breed or species. techniques are now available to control inbreeding using conventional blup methods ( villanue, 2009) In breeding systems of negligible environmental stress , the need for both energy and physiological mechanisms to alleviate stress are not required. Selection for production traits would have serious negative consequences for future cattle herds. Cattle breeds of the developed countries have been subjected to breeding programmes that are not sustainable. We argue that for cattle of the 21st century it will be necessary to explore the evolution of cattle in unfavourable environments. The response to environmental stress involves a synergy between behaviour and physiological adaptation. We present data from experiments that aimed to assess the evolutionary adaptation of b. taurus cattle to stress. By the end of last century, estimates of the yearly global costs of cattle tick and tick - borne diseases were between us$13.9 and us$18.7 billion. exploring the full repertoire of the animal 's anti - tick mechanisms is warranted if genetic technologies that utilize naturally occurring adaptation to parasitic stress are going to contribute to sustainable livestock production. The origins of the adaptaur began on belmont in 1980 with the identification of a heifer ( animal identity : 790546 ) of the 1979 calf crop of the hs line. The heifer acquired extreme resistance to field infestations of cattle tick soon after weaning ( subsequent counts of zero or one regardless of tick counts of cohorts ) There was no evidence of hypersensitivity and a grooming response to remove larvae within 24 h of infestation. Twenty - seven years after the identification of heifer 790546 , in 2007 descendents from this heifer exhibited high tick resistance. At 48-h postinfestation , the adaptaur straightbred has not lost its high resistance to cattle tick , even after 27 years. High tick resistance appears to be conferred to other taurine breeds regardless of their genetic background for tick resistance ( table 2) Number of bos indicus ( straightbred brahman ) and bos taurus ( adaptaur and f1 adaptaur cross ) 24-month - old heifers in each class of tick resistance from an artificial infestation of cattle tick ( rhipicephalus microplus ) on belmont research station november 2007. tick resistance class was based on number of maturing ticks from cumulative tick counts ( /side ) on days 1921 from 10 000 larvae. Exudate assessed at the site of larval release 48-h postinfestation of the 10,000 larvae.  n'dama not only possesses a genetic capacity to control parasitism ( claxton and leperre 1991 ) , but also to avoid anaemia and the severe pathology associated with trypanosome infection. A major gene for hair length  slick hair that contributes to improving the animal 's thermoregulatory ability, has been described in both senepol and venezuelan carora. High selection intensity ( high growth and high tick resistance ) on fitness traits was successful for european b. taurus in a tropical environment. The transition from unadapted to an adapted state for the n'dama, adaptaur, senepol and criollo could also involve elements of phenotypic plasticity. The development of b. taurus cattle and the selection pressures imposed by different environments. Global warming, with elevated ambient temperatures , altered rainfall patterns and changed distributions of parasites and pathogens will also impact livestock evolutionary trajectories. Understanding the taurine evolutionary trajectoryories also provides an insight into the predictability of cattle performance in cattle industries. In a systems framework , it is the interactions between genotype, environment and management that contribute to evolution of different genotypes. Figure 2 shows the relative production potential of temperate and tropical b. taurus in the presence and absence of management to negate the effect of increasing levels of environmental stress. The decline in production of the tropically adapted b.Taurus is substantially less than the decline of the temperate b. Taurus. The major hurdle to achieving economic sustainability will be the acknowledgement that no single genotype will outperform all other genotypes regardless of environmental conditions. interactions between genotype and management occur when performances of different genotypes are not equally affected by different management inputs. understanding g  e  m and its impact on genetic , environmental and managerial strategies is crucial in future livestock systems. The physiological antagonism between production potential and adaptation ensures no genotype achieves highest performance in all environments. The evolutionary history and knowledge of the genetic architecture will provide estimates of production potential ( in a favourable environment ) and level of resistance to environmental stress ( in an unfavourable environment )\",\n",
       " \"Severe sepsis and septic shock still represent a leading cause of intensive care unit ( icu ) admission with a case fatality rate of 3040%. Systemic inflammation results from a maladaptive unbalance between early antimicrobial immune reactions and uncontrolled local infection and inflammation. Mannose - binding lectin is a soluble pattern recognition molecule which activates the lectin pathway of the complement system and the subsequent inflammatory mechanisms.  mbl plays a central role as a first - line defense against invading pathogens by triggering complement system. In humans there are two genes that might code for mbl , but only mbl2 gene is functional. mbl deficiency may be due to the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snp) alveolar lavage ( bal ) levels ranging between 20 and 80  ng / ml , but these results were not corrected for dilution factors ( i.e. urea or other lung proteins with known lung concentration) Low mbl plasmatic levels are generally detected in heterozygous patients ( a / o genotype) homozygous variant mbl2 alleles usually present very low concentrations. An increasing body of evidence has indicated that mbl deficit generally increases frequency and severity of infectious episodes. The structure of our immune system is redundant, and this may explain why in many cases polymorphisms of mbl2 gene were not observed to influence susceptibility to infections. The incidence and outcome of severe infections appear to be influenced by the levels and activity of mannose - binding lectin. Mnose - binding lectin is not only part of the innate recognition system of invasive pathogens but effectively modulates the cytokines ' production by macrophages during phagocytosis. polymorphisms of this gene were observed in seven of ten white patients with chronic necrotizing aspergillosis compared with 25% of controls. Two functional mbl genes exist in the mouse. The generation of double knockout gene - deficient mice has increased the investigations in this field. Mbl - null mice showed at 48 hours 100% mortality compared with wild - type ( wt ) mice which survived in a percentage of 55% . pretreatment of mbl- null mice with rhmbl increased their survival rate of about 50%  turkish authors have investigated the possible relationship between cord blood mbl levels and neonatal sepsis. mbl deficiency was associated with susceptibility , poor outcome , and duration of febrile neutropenic episodes in pediatric oncological patients. impaired innate immune mechanisms may also increase the risk of nosocomial infections in critically ill patients. In a cohort of 195 adult septic patients, mbl deficiency was associated with higher sequential organ failure assessment ( sofa ) score at day 3. In a multicenter prospective study involving eight adults icus in u. k. , the association between mbl-2 exon and promoter polymorphisms with the outcome of 174 patients affected by severe sepsis was found to be significant. Mbl deficiency significantly increased the risk of death due to severe infection. The association between mbl deficiency and s. pneumoniae invasive infection outcome has been recently investigated in a spanish prospective cohort study. In nonbacterial severe systemic infections, invasive candidiasis ( ic ) still remains a leading cause of death.  serum mbl levels were measured in 68 patients with proven ic, 82 hospitalized not infected patients, and 70 healthy subjects. mbl concentration was significantly higher in ic patients than controls. The authors identified a marked decrease in its plasmatic levels during the first days of infection in association with mannans increase. Human protein during severe sepsis and septic shock affecting deficient patients has been proposed but it still remains an experimental treatment. Until new promising and robust data will be available , the strict adherence to current standard recommendations still remains the mainstay of severe Sepsis / Septic shock management.\",\n",

A 58-year - old man was admitted with unstable angina and complaining of new onset substernal chest pain at rest. The patient had a history of prior percutaneous coronary intervention at this hospital due to angina pectoris ten years ago. The coronary angiogram ( cag) showed 90% stenosis at the proximal portion of the left anterior descending coronary ( lad) A new - generation drug eluting stent ( xience v , 4.028 mm ) was successfully placed to cover the previously stented lesion. Post - stenting ivus revealed a well expanded previous isr lesion ( minimal stent area=7.31 mm ) A 2.7523 mm stent was also successfully deployed in the de novo lcx lesion. At the nine months follow up , cag showed patent stented lesions without evidence of isr.  oct imaging allowed detection of more detailed changes of neointima such as multiple tiny ulcerations and a tcfa with a large lipid core. oct has a higher sensitivity than ivus for characterizing lipid - rich plaques. The higher resolution of oct allows improved visualization of soft tissue components and detection of the cause of acs.',\n",
       " 'Forensic dentistry is mainly involved in the identification of deceased individuals. The most common methods of identification include visual identification, fingerprinting , serologic and dna comparison , and anthropologic examination of bone. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the association of the oral and craniofacial clinical signs observed in human identification procedure with specific genetic condition. The craniofacial features of this syndrome include frontal bossing, facial asymmetry, aplasia of alar cartilage, ocular hypertelorism and strabismus. malformations of the hands are more common than those of the feet and include the syndactyly, brachydactsyly and clinodactyyly. almost all affected individuals are females, as male fetuses with the syndrome die before birth.  turner syndrome occurs in one out of every 2500 to 3000 female births and is associated with a broad array of potential abnormalities. major clinical manifestations include : growth failure, congenital heart disease ( e.g. coarctation of the aorta , bicuspid aortic valve , atrial , and ventricular septal defects ) , gonadal failure , and learning disabilities.  mfs is often diagnosed in association with other disorders of the connective tissue. skeletal anomalies are the easiest signs to see39,40 as flat feet, deep - set eyes, long thin arms, and legs. many people with mfs will have some type of vision problem including myopia, glaucoma, cataracts. oral manifestations such as dental caries and periodontal diseases also have an increased incidence in patients with the mfs. Apert syndrome ( mendelian inheritance in man # 101200 ) represents approximately 5% of all craniosynostosis syndromes. cs is an autosomal dominant genetic disease with an incidence of 1 in 25,000 births. The mutation in the genes that codify receptor two of the fibroblast growth factor 2 is responsible for the deformities observed.  ofd i or orofaciodigital dysostosis is a genetic disorder that affects 1 in 50,000 to 1 in 250,000 live births. The craniofacial features of this syndrome include frontal bossing, facial asymmetry, aplasia of alar cartilage, strabismus, down slanting palpebral fissures, broadened nasal bridge / root, cleft lip / palate.  turner syndrome is a common genetic disorder that has been classically associated with a 45x karyotype. It occurs in one out of every 2500 to 3000 female births. It is associated with various health problems ( e.g. hypotonia , congenital heart defects , gastrointestinal diseases ) and distinctive physical stigmata. persons with t21 are at high risk of being rejected socially.  mfs is an autosomal disease of the connective tissue that is characterized by skeletal anomalies and arachnodactyly. classic mfs occurs due to a mutation in the fbn1 gene , which codifies for the matrix protein fibrillin. most cases remain undiagnosed till puberty when the symptoms of androgen deficiency are recognized.  pycnodysostosis is a rare autosomal - recessive disorder of osteoclast dysfunction due to mutation of cathepsin k gene46 causing osteosclerosis. apert syndrome ( mendelian inheritance in man # 101200 ) represents approximately 5% of all craniosynostosis syndromes.

       " 'Gap between the real and virtual radiology department is decreasing day by day. Of the 100 studies evaluated, 27 demonstrated intracranial bleeds. There was complete concurrence between the ipad and desktop in 99 of the studies. Forty - eight of the 49 bleeds were detected by one of the radiologists on the  ipad. A tiny ivh was missed by both radiologists  on ich as well as on the desktop workstation. The ipad holds great potential in medical imaging, especially for small matrix scans. The ipad is portable and lightweight and is a powerful computing device with an intuitive interface. There was no statistically significant difference ( p value < 1.00 ) between the ipad and desktop workstation in detection of hemorrhage. The results of our study indicate that the ipad may indeed be adequate for the display of small matrix radiological images , equaling the performance of desktop computers. We conclude that in the emergency setting , a mobile device with appropriate web - based pacs is effective in the detection of ich present on head ct.',\n",
       " \"vitamin d has been a hot topic in the medical world for the past 10 years. It is now recognized that everyone is at risk for vitamin d deficiency. Vitamin d deficiency is prevalent in india, a finding that is unexpected in a tropical country with abundant sunshine. The 4-carbon ring backbone makes it more of a steroid hormone than a vitamin. Vitamin d plays an important role in priming cells for other hormones to do their action. vitamin d itself is devoid of any biological activity , but enzymatic conversion to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d generates the hormonal form with diverse biological activities. The 24,25(oh ) 2d synthesized by the placenta accumulates in bone and may be involved in ossification of the fetal skeleton. Vitamin d deficiency can result in lower bone mineral density and an increased risk of bone loss ( osteoporosis ) or bone fracture. vitamin d is a unique nutrient because its requirement can be met by both endogenous production from sunlight as well as exogenous dietary sources. Vitamin d is present in a small number of foods , although for an average person food will only supply about 10% of the amount needed. Women with darker skin fitzpatrick class 6 are more prone to vitamin d deficiency. Women with intestinal malabsorption diseases like celiac disease and crohn 's disease absorb less of both dietary and supplemental vitamin d. Certain medications like steroids, anti - epileptic medications , cholesterol - lowering drugs reduce absorption of vitamin d from the intestines. Most prenatal vitamins have around 400 iu of vitamin d , and most health groups recommend taking no more than 2,000 iu in supplement form daily. hypercalciuria due to excessive vitamin d intakes is always accompanied by circulating 25(oh ) d concentrations > 250nmol / l ( 100 ng / ml) hypervitaminosis d has never occurred when physiologic amounts of Vitamin d are ingested. Preeclampsia rates are elevated during winter months when sunlight - dependent 25(oh ) d productions are reduced. Vitamin d deficiency during early pregnancy significantly increases the risk for gestational diabetes in later pregnancy. vitamin d status has been linked to the human innate immune system and its ability to contain mycobacterium tuberculosis. Vitamin d deficiency results in proximal muscle weakness and decreased lower extremity muscle function perhaps contributing to the risk for cesarean section in nulliparous women. The cochrane review concluded that there is not enough evidence to evaluate the requirements and effects of vitamin d supplementation during pregnancy. Vitamin d - deficiency in mothers have significantly increased risk of infantile rickets due to inadequate maternal  fetal transfer of 25-hydroxyvitamin d. Vitamin d supplementation of 400 iu / day to breast fed infants is the most secure way of preventing rickets in infants. Vitamin d supplementation is not a part of antenatal care programs in india. Women of reproductive age are assumed to be able to obtain the recommended intake for almost all vitamins without the use of supplements. No national organization recommends routine vitamin d supplementation during pregnancy unless a woman is at nutritional risk. Questions have been raised regarding the need for standardization of assays. Vitamin d supplementation is effective in improving the vitamin d status of asian and white women. It improves growth in the first year of life in south asian babies and therefore may contribute to reducing the incidence of rickets in this latter group. getting 25(oh ) d levels consistently above 75 nmol / l ( 30 ng / ml ) may require at least 1500 - 2000 iu / day of vitamin d. Vitamin d is present in a small number of foods. For an average person food will only supply about 10% of the amount needed. Vitamin d is a unique nutrient because its requirement can be met by both endogenous production from sunlight as well as exogenous dietary sources. Women with darker skin are more prone to vitamin d deficiency. Women who take high doses of vitamin d during pregnancy have a greatly reduced risk of complications, including gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and infection. Vitamin d has long been believed to cause birth defects. Most health groups recommend taking no more than 2,000 iu of the vitamin in supplement form daily.  adequate vitamin d intake is essential for maternal and fetal health during pregnancy. vitamin d deficiency during pregnancy is linked with preeclampsia, insulin resistance, gestational diabetes mellitus, bacterial vaginosis, and an increased risk for caesarean section delivery. No case of hypervitaminosis d from sun exposure has ever been reported. Vitamin d supplementation in early pregnancy should be explored for preventing preeclampsia and promoting neonatal well - being. Vitamin d status has very recently been linked to the human innate immune system and its ability to contain mycobacterium tuberculosis. The cochrane review concluded that there is not enough evidence to evaluate the requirements and effects of vitamin d supplementation during pregnancy. Vitamin d deficiency in mothers has significantly increased risk of infantile rickets due to inadequate maternal  fetal transfer of 25-hydroxyvitamin d. vitamin d supplementation of 400 iu / day to breast fed infants is the most secure way of preventing rickets in infants. maternal deficiency may lead to adverse outcomes in offspring. Maternal vitamin d concentrations are related to offspring birth weight and growth during the postnatal years. lower maternal vitamin d status was associated with lower bone mineral concentration and impaired glucose homeostasis in newborn infants. vitamin d deficiency during pregnancy is also associated with risks of health problems later in childhood. Vitamin d supplementation is not a part of antenatal care programs in india.  serum 25-hydroxyvitamin d is the accepted biomarker to be offered early in pregnancy. Although 1,25(oh ) 2d is the active circulating form of vitamin d , measuring this level is not helpful because it is quickly and tightly regulated by the kidney. true deficiency would be evident only by measuring 25(oh) d. 600 iu in prenatal vitamins remains the recommended daily intake for pregnant women. Getting 25(oh ) d levels consistently above 75 nmol / l ( 30 ng / ml ) may require at least 1500 - 2000 iu / day of vitamin d. If a mother is vitamin d deficient, breast milk is not a good source of Vitamin d. infants need to be given vitamin d supplementation until they are weaned.\",\n",
       " ' permeability of concrete is defined as the ease with which a fluid, liquid , or gas flows through it under pressure. The lower the permeability, the more durable the concrete would be. fibre reinforced concrete ( frc) is a composite material comprising cement, aggregate, and randomly distributed discrete fibres. short, discrete , and randomly distribution fibres have been found to be very effective in overcoming some of the deficiencies of conventional concrete.  hybrid steel fibre reinforced concrete ( hysfrc) is the most recent advancement in the field of frc. The durability of concrete depends largely upon the permeability of concrete which is defined as the ease with which it allows the fluids to pass through it. This study attempted to investigate the combined effect of addition of hybrid steel fibres on the water permeability and strength characteristics. Corrugated steel fibres , 12.5  mm, 25  mm , and 50  mm long were used in different combinations by weight. In all 40 concrete mixes the inverted slump cone test was used to measure the workability of concrete containing different combinations of steel fibre. The time taken to empty the cone for all the mixes used in this investigation was within limits prescribed for frc. Water permeability of fibrous concrete was obtained by testing specimens in a water permeability tester. The seal was allowed to harden for 24 hours and then was checked by passing air from the bottom while covering the top surface with the layer of water. absence of any air bubble emerging out of the seal confirmed that the seal was perfect. 39 mixes were tested for compressive strength, split tensile strength, and water permeability at 7, 28, 90, and 120 days of curing. Results for different mixes containing different combinations of steel fibres are presented in the following sections as the trends are more or less similar at other curing ages. For mono steel fibre mixes, at a volume fraction of 0.5% , the compressed strength was found to increase by 5.28% , 24.06% , and 16.82% with the addition of 100% 12.5  mm, 100% 25  mm , and 100% 50  mm long fibres. The optimum fibre length for compressive strength for all the volume fractions tested for sfrc mixes is 25  mm , whereas 12.5  mm long fibres performed poorly. This may be due to the fact that some minimum fibre length is required to resist the cracks and their propagation. For 50  mm fibres their number for particular volume fraction is less as compared to 25 mm fibres and thus may not be as effective in arresting the propagation of cracks. For binary steel fibre mixes of 100% 12.5  mm and 100% 50  mm long steel fibres, increase in the compressive strength of the order of 15.73% , 12.67% , and 10.55% for 0.5% , 1.0% and 1.5%. over plain concrete mix was observed at 28 days of curing. for hysfrc mix, which contained 50% 25  mm + 50% 50\\xa0miles\\xa0of\\xa0steel, the Compressive strength was increased by 18.79% , 23.88% and 21.34% over plain\\xa0concrete\\xa0mix. For a particular fibre volume fraction , the highest compressive strength is obtained for a mix made with 100% 25  mm steel fibres. The lowest value is given by a mix of 75% 12.5  mm long fibre followed by aMix made of 75%. 25% 25. mm long fibres at a volume fraction of 1.5%. For mono steel fibre mixes, the split tensile strength was found to increase by 4.88% , 18.16% , and 26.29% over plain concrete mix. Figure 5 presents typical trends for split tensile strength of mixes containing mono steel fibres at a fibre volume fraction of 0.5% . for mono steel fibre mixes. for mixes made with 100% 12.5  mm long fibres, the split Tensile strength was. increased by 4.88% , 10.57% , and 12.74% for 0. 5% , 1.0% and 1.5%. figure 6 presents the influence of fibre volume. fraction on the split tensle strength of mono steel. fibres made with. 100% 50  mmLong fibres over plain concrete. For hysfrc mix, which contained 50% 12.5  mm + 50% 25  mm long steel fibres, the split tensile strength was increased by 10.84% , 17.07% , and 15.72% over plain concrete mix at 28 days of curing. For binary steel fibre mixes, with the addition of 75% 12 \\xa0mm + 25% 50  mm, increase in the split Tensile strength of the order of 8.67% , 18.70% and 21.68% for 0.5% and 1.0% fibre content. For hysfrc mix which contained 50% 25  mm + 50% 50  mm long steel fibres, the split tensile strength was increased by 30.08% , 33.60% , and 31.71% over plain concrete mix at 28 days of curing. for a particular fibre volume fraction , the highest split Tensile strength is obtained for a mix made with 33% 12.5  mm plus 33% 25\\xa0 mm + 33% 50\\xa0 mm long fibres. The lowest value of the. split tensle strength is given by a mixmade with 100% 12\\xa05\\xa0mm long fibre followed by a. mix made of 75%\\xa012.5\\xa0miles + 25% 25 m The split tensile strength increase is more sensitive to fibre length than volume fraction in case of binary combinations of fibre. In case of ternary combinations , the influence of fibre volume fraction is almost negligible. For mono steel fibre reinforced concrete ( sfrc ) mixes , for volume fraction of 0.5% and at 28 days of curing , the coefficient of water permeability was found to decrease over plain concrete mix ( control mix ) by 68.42% and 45.45% respectively. ivity of porous channels present in the concrete , thus resulting in lower water permeability. The maximum decrease in the water. permeability of sfrc mixes made with 12.5  mm long fibres as compared to relatively long. fibres such as 25  mm and 50  mm may be attributed to the fact that the short fibres are more in number and are more effective in breaking the paths through which water can travel. In the coefficient of water permeability over plain concrete was observed to be 65.99% , 75.74% , and 30.46% for 0.5% , 1.0% and 1.5%, respectively. as the amount of short fibres in a particular mix is decreased or short. fibres are partially or fully replaced by relatively long fibres , an increase in the water. permeability is observed. No single fibre combination can be adjudged as the best combination for all these properties.  properties of hysfrc containing different combinations of steel fibres of different lengths and plain concrete in hardened state have been investigated. Tests such as compressive strength , split tensile strength , and water permeability were conducted on hardened concrete after 7, 28, 90 and 120 days of curing. A total of 40 mixes were considered and approximately 1440 specimens were tested in this investigation. Fibre mix containing 100% 25  mm long steel fibres at fibre volume fraction of 1.5% increased split tensile strength of hysfrc by 29.54% over plain concrete. 46.07% increase in split Tensile strength was observed with respect to plain concrete with a fibre mix ratio of 33% 12.5  mm + 33% 25 and 50 mm long fibres.',\n",
       " \"Endodontic sealers have been developed to improve the sealing and bonding to root dentin. These materials seal within the canal system any irritants that are not removed during chemomechanical preparation. manufacturers have further incorporated adhesive dentistry in endodontics by introducing obturation systems with a specific focus on obtaining a monoblock. Cleaning and shaping was done by using 0.06 taper k3niti rotary instruments in a gear reduction handpiece ( rotary master , j.morita , usa ) upto size # 40. The canals were irrigated with 3% sodium hypochlorite during instrumentation with a final rinse of 17% ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid. Sixty extracted single - rooted , single - canal anterior teeth were collected and stored in 0.1%thymol solution until use. teeth were decoronated at cementoenamel junction ( cej ) with diamond disc and standardized to 10 mm + 1 mm length. specimen was subjected to push - out test using universal testing machine where the plunger moved in an apical to coronal direction at a crosshead speed of 1 mm / min. The diameter of each obturation site was measured and recorded. This measurement and thickness measurements were used to calculate the bonded area of the filling material. The data obtained was subjected to two way analysis of variance and scheffe 's test. The mean push - out bond strength for each group were as follows : group i ( gutta - percha / ah plus ) : 1.49 + 0.16mpa , group ii ( resilon / epiphany se ) : 0.95 + 0.,13mpa and group iii ( endorezobturation system ) :0.56 + 0,15mpa. An improved bond and creation of monoblockare considered to be the main advantages of resilon / epihanyse and endorez oburation system. These properties should be reflected by improvements in interfacial strength between root - filling material and intraradicular dentin. In the present study, group i ( gutta - percha / ah plus ) showed highest bond strength. Group ii ( resilon / epiphany se ) showed lower bond strength compared to group i ( gutta - percha / ah plus ) but higher than group iii ( endorezobturation system ) The results of the present study correlate well with that of other studies who also used push - out test design and found higher bond strengths. lock  formation by the new resin - based sealers. The adhesiveness quality to root dentin promoted by both resin -based sealers is compromised even when teeth with simple anatomic features were obturated. The higher push - out bond strength found in the gutta - percha / ah plus root fillings reiterate the fact that the era of conventional nonbonding root filling has not yet come to an end.\",\n",
       " 'numerous beneficial effects of an adequate vitamin d status on a wide range of clinical conditions have been proposed. During the 21st century there has been a flowering of knowledge of metabolism of vitamin d within a range of tissues. In this article i will review the current knowledge for the action of Vitamin d on plasma calcium and phosphate homeostasis and bone mineral homeostatic with particular focus on the knowledge gaps. The catabolism of vitamin d metabolites through the action of the 25-hydroxyvitamin-24-hydroxylase ( cyp24 ) has also been demonstrated to be an essential regulatory pathway for vitamin d homeostasis. Under conditions when this enzyme activity is reduced or ablated the serum half - lives of both 25d and 1,25d are increased and contribute to the development of hypercalcaemia. Pth acts rapidly on the kidney to stimulate renal calcium reabsorption from the glomerular filtrate. In concert with 1,25d it stimulates bone resorption to enhance the flow of calcium from bone into plasma. It is this mechanism that can maintain serum 1, 25d in the normal range or at adequate levels. Rickets in children ( or osteomalacia in adults when bone growth has ceased ) is the index disease for vitamin d deficiency. Strong data have been generated from rodent models and human disease to indicate that dietary deficiency or genetic ablation of vitamin d activity results in hypocalcaemia, hypophosphataemia, hyperparathyroidism and rickets. Mouse models in which vitamin d activity has been ablated either by knocking out the gene for the vdr or the cyp27b1 enzyme develop rickets. fracture efficacy at the hip or other non - vertebral sites is not achieved until serum 25d levels of 75 nmol / l are achieved. Dietary studies in rodent models demonstrate that at levels of serum 25d between 20 and 80 nmol / l, osteomalacia is observed. optimal bone status is dependent on adequate vitamin d and dietary calcium status rather than either one alone. Increased dietary calcium intake increases the expression of the cyp27b1 gene in bone by three - fold and reduces this gene in the kidney. 1,25d in plasma arises from sequential hydroxylations of vitamin d by the liver and the kidney. The binding of 1,25D to its highly specific nuclear receptor , vdr , modulates transcriptional activity of Vitamin d responsive genes. The current controversial issue is what is the critical level for serum 25d to maintain plasma calcium homeostasis.  parathyroid hormone ( pth ) and calcitonin act on the kidney , bone and gut. low calcium increases pth secretion and synthesis whereas high calcium increases calciton in synthesis. 1,25d in association with pth increases the number of osteoclasts by way of an indirect mechanism. ocrine actions of 1,25d to maintain plasma calcium homeostasis is 20 nmol / l or greater. The level of bone mineral at any one time is the result of at least two opposing cellular actions , bone formation by osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts. rickets in children ( or osteomalacia in adults when bone growth has ceased ) is the index disease for vitamin d deficiency. Mouse models in which vitamin d activity has been ablated either by knocking out the gene for the vdr or the cyp27b1 enzyme develop rickets when fed a normal calcium diet. When the dietary calcium and the phosphate levels are markedly increased sufficient to normalise plasma calcium and phosphate levels, the rickets phenotype is rescued. d only in mature osteoblasts and some osteocytes . these mice demonstrate increased trabecular bone volume in females at 20 weeks of age ( 25 ) . these latest results have only been published as abstracts and are only preliminary at this time. At 25d levels below 20 nmol / l and dietary calcium of 4% , osteomalacia is observed. Pth activity is increased when serum 25 d levels fall below 60 nmol / l ( 32 ) presumably arising from stimulation of the parathyroid gland calcium - sensing receptor as a result of a slight fall in plasma ionized calcium level. The interaction between pth and serum 1,25d stimulates osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption increasing the flow of calcium and phosphate into the plasma compartment.  serum 25d level of 20 nmol / l or greater appears to be sufficient to provide adequate substrate for the renal cyp27b1 enzyme level. This lower level is adequate because the renal. cyp 27b1 enzymes level is increased by increasing levels of pth when serum. 25d levels fall below 60 nmol/ l ( 32 ) in contrast bone cyp25b1. enzyme levels are not increased by pth and therefore higher levels of serum 25D are required for bone cells to produce sufficient bone tissue to suppress osteoclastogenesis.',\n",
       " 'The chronic periapical inflammation influences odontogenesis in permanent dentition after the period of approximately 6 weeks. A thin fibrous barrier between inflammation zone and enamel epithelium remains as a response to short - term infection. This article presents a case of a malformed permanent tooth resulting from the infection of the overlying deciduous tooth. The radiolucency was seen in the interradicular area and around the root apices of 64 and 65. The specimen was sent for histopathological examination. The gross specimen consisted of multiple bits of soft tissue and a hard tissue. The soft tissue was pinkish - gray with the largest bit measuring 2 cm  2 cm. The whitish hard tissue measuring 7 mm  7mm  8 mm resembled hollow crypt like / domed like structure. Soft tissue surrounding the crypt consisted of the cystic lumen , cystic lining and connective tissue capsule. cystic lesion showed stratified squamous odontogenic epithelium with columnar ciliated cells. areas of transversely cut dentinal tubules were seen merging with haversian canal. outermost thickness of the crypt showed predominantly lamellated bone like arrangement with the presence of concentric lamellaes and haverian canals. above features were suggestive of radicular cyst associated with 64 and 65 along with malformed permanent tooth. Pulpal and periapical lesions more or less have the same course in deciduous and permanent dentition. Pulpal lesions can progress from acute lesions to chronic lesions. Posterior\\xa0deciduous possess more chances of being affected than anterior teeth due to their anatomical makeup and extended duration of stay in oral cavity. st associated with malformed permanent tooth was given on excisional biopsy. radicular cysts are considered rare in the primary teeth and are often ignored. This may be due to flaring of the roots in deciduous molars providing it with more blood supply and immunity.  pathological morpho- and histo - differentiation of the other tooth bud undergoing calcification may be the cause of malformed tooth in the present case. In pathologic inflammatory situations , the cells of connective tissue and inflammation imbalance in the production of these factors is very important cause of tissue degeneration and mal - development of the tooth.',\n",
       " 'Lingthening with external fixator alone is fraught with complications. High incidence of deep intramedullary infection of up to 22% is a universal concern. Lengthening over plate ( lop) eliminates the risk of creating a deep intramsulmonary infection. This procedure can also be used in any age group of patients. Tibia was chosen for lengthening in order to avoid any interference of the external fixator with the plate and minimize the risk of infection. The case with proximal femur nonunion was plated and bone grafted and tibial lengthening was done over a plate. The average duration of followup was 2 years. A 3.5/4.5 mm lcdcp ( pitkar, pune, india) was placed externally over the medial surface of the bone around the proposed lengthening site. The plate was slid extraperiosteally through a small vertical incision at the planned corticotomy site. No muscle dissection was required as would have been needed for lateral plating. A 3.5/4.5 mm lcdcp ( pitkar , pune , india ) was placed externally over the medial surface of the bone around the proposed lengthening site. The plate was slid extraperiosteally through a small vertical incision at the planned corticotomy site so that plate insertion and corticotomies could be done through one. Plate was slid over the bone extraperiosteally on the medial surface. The plate was fixed to the proximal fragment with at least three screws using stab incisions. Patients were allowed to walk full weight bearing from the next day. distraction was started from postoperative day 7 at the rate of 1 mm / day. There were a total of eight complications with three problems ( two pin tract infections and one plate prominence ) , two obstacles ( one tendo achilles contracture and one deep infection ) , and three sequelae. The single case of infection in our series was a 17 year old boy with tibial lengthening with fibular hemimelia. The poor skin quality and multiple surgical and lengthening procedures may have been the cause of infection. Long fixator duration of soft tissue transfixion can cause recurrent pin tract infections. Long fixator also commonly results in knee joint stiffness in femoral lengthening. Lon reduces the external fixatorduration and the consolidation index. infection rates of up to 22% have been reported. Lop is effective in lengthening ( mean lengthening 4.1 cm ) , it drastically reduces the fixator time ( mean ex - fix index  19.2 days / cm ) and maintains low complication rates ( complication rate 0.5 per segment lengthened) In spite of these advantages , we had one case of deep infection in our small series of 16 lop procedures. There were four cases of septic arthritis of hip and one each of congenital short femur, proximal femur nonunion, and idiopathic chondrolysis of femoral head. The only patient in whom we lengthened the femur was the case with congenitalShortFemur. For the other six with femoral shortening , we lengnowed the tibia. There is one unicortical screw through the slot in the distal segment, which may add to the stability. The slot does not decrease near fixation because the plate comes in different slot lengths and we use the slot length based on the of target length. The process of achieving an entire plating procedure in the presence of an external fixator may be cumbersome. Only one distraction rod needs to be removed to accomplish distal locking , which makes the procedure very simple. In none of our patients , there was any need to delay the distallocking and in all patients fixator was removed early. However , more work in the form of randomized studies with the lon technique needs to do to delineate its role.',\n",
       " 'pupil dilatation unresponsive to light stimuli and decreased constriction response to accommodation is known as tonic pupil. Most tonic pupils cases are idiopathic , but among all known causes , trauma is the most frequent. It has been described following ocular surgery, electrocoagulation and pars plana vitrectomy. There are few reports published in the literature on tonic pupil following retinal surgery. infrared diode laser (810 nm) produces a much deeper coagulation when compared to argon laser and affects the retinal pigment epithelium and choriocapillaris. This could be more related to short ciliary nerve damage. ervation types can be damaged with an intense laser photocoagulation and that respecting horizontal retinal meridians during the treatment may not always help to preserve these nerves. We hypothesize that there might also be a vascular etiology in the ciliary nerves lesion of our patient. eb has been reported to induce relative ischemia to anterior ocular structures.',\n",
       " \"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( hsct) is associated with several serious side effects. These are generally grouped into three categories : infectious complications, drug toxicity , and graft - versus - host disease ( gvhd) gvHD manifests in an acute and chronic form with distinct clinical signs and symptoms. All aspects of this study were reviewed and approved by the regional ethical committee in stockholm. 29 patients and their corresponding sibling donors gave their informed consent and were included in the current study. The remaining 15 patient / donor pairs were excluded from further studies due to established or suspected acute gvhd grade i. PBMcs were isolated from peripheral blood samples using density - gradient centrifugation. They were cryopreserved at 196c with 10% dmso in complete rpmi-1640 medium. The cells were incubated with 1 m carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester ( cfse) We used responder cells that were either untreated or stained in complete medium alone with 10 g / ml phytohemagglutinin a ( pha ; sigma - aldrich , st ) as controls. Cells were harvested, stained, and analysed by flow cytometry. lymphocytes were distinguished from monocytes by their side- and forward - scatter phenotype. The milliplex map human cytokine / chemokine - premixed 26 plex from millipore was performed according to manufacturer 's protocol. Data was analysed and displayed using graphpad prism software ( graphpad software inc . , san diego , ca ) and ibm spss statistics 23 software ( ibm , armonk , ny , usa ) levels and changes in cell - surface markers and levels of soluble factors were compared between the non - gvhd and gvHD groups. The following markers were studied on unmanipulated donor pbmcs : cd3, cd4, cd8, ccr7, cd45ra, cd28, cd69, cd94, tcr, The non - ghvd group had a higher frequency of total tcr  nave memory t - cells than the gvhd group ( median 4.5% versus 0.7% ; p = 0.004 ) ( figure 2(a) ) after activation, t - Cells transiently express certain nk - cell markers. No significant differences were seen between the two categories of donors when we analysed total frequencies of cd4 and cd8 t - cell or their individual maturation status. There was no significant difference in cytokine concentrations in the supernatant of all three conditions after mlc between the two patient groups. No difference in cell proliferation as measured by cfse could be observed ( data not shown ) . most studies on the effect of graft composition on outcome after hsct have focused on quantitative differences in doses of total nucleated cells, cd34cells , and t - cells.  flow cytometry on graft material using the most common phenotypic markers is not enough to detect predictive markers for gvhd. biological functions of t - cells that express the  t - cell receptor ( tcr ) are not fully understood. existing evidence points towards both proinflammatory and suppressive functions as well as antigen - presenting and cytotoxic capacities. Other minor lymphocyte populations that have attracted attention in the context of hsct are t - cells expressing nk - cell markers. These can be either naturally occurring invariant nkt - cells or in vitro activated cytokine - induced killer ( cik ) cells. Both cell subsets have been shown to have antitumour and tolerogenic abilities in preclinical studies. Staining of unmanipulated donor pbmcs for cd95 revealed that samples from the gvhd group contained lower proportions of nave t - cells that expressed this receptor on their surface. The fas - fasl interaction is of particular importance for establishing peripheral tolerance and it has been shown to have a role in attenuation of gvHD. We found a positive correlation between lower frequencies of donor t - cells expressing tcr  and nk - cell markers on the one hand and incidence of acute gvhd grades ii  iv. We also found that a distinct relative decrease in cd69 t- cells in a flow cytometry - based allogeneic mlc can be predictive of acutegvhd. In conclusion , our results indicate that phenotypic analysis of the donor lymphocyte subpopulations before transplantation can yield predictive information of clinical relevance.\",\n",
       " 'Necrotizing enterocolitis ( nec) is predominantly a disease of premature infants. nec is exaggerated inflammation mediated by potent inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) and platelet activating factor ( paf) In human studies, newborn infants who developed nec expressed significantly higher serum tnF levels compared to controls. In animal models of nec, animals treated with anti-tnf antibodies have lower incidence and severity of disease. Both acute and chronic exposure to tnf have developmental - stage dependent effects on the developing small intestine. All genetically modified mice were maintained on a c57bl/6j background. Animals were housed under normal conditions at the animal care facility at the university of iowa. All animal experiments were performed according to protocols approved by the institutional animal care and use committee.  cells were quantified with a 60x objective ( 600x total magnification ) by a single blinded investigator. intestinal sections from at least five animals were analyzed for each experimental group and at least 100 crypts were counted per animal. ileal samples were homogenized using a tissuelyser lt ( qiagen ) , then cleared , and boiled as previously described. membranes were blocked for 1  h in tris - buffered saline with 0.05% tween 20 ( tbst ) and 5% nonfat dry milk , incubated with anti - tnfr1 primary antibody ( santa cruz biotechnology ) overnight at 4c. We measured the length of ileal villi at various stages of development throughout the first four weeks of life of the mouse. birth did not affect villus length , as there was no difference between e19 and p0 mice. tnf induced significant villus blunting at p7, p14, p21, and p28. In contrast, p0 pups were protected from this effect, suggesting either the presence of a protective signaling pathway or decreased responsiveness. Tnf can affect both intestinal epithelial cells and ileal goblet cells through tnf receptor-1 ( tnfr1 ) signaling [ 13 , 16 ] We tested if the tnF - dependent effects on villus length , area , and epithelial cell mass were also dependent on tnFr1. To accomplish this, mice were treated with tn Fr1 and their villus measurements were compared to knockout controls. Mice exposed to chronic tnf showed a significant loss in villus length. There was no significant difference in tnfr1 levels in either b- or c - tnF groups compared to controls. The effects demonstrate a developmental stage - dependent effect of chronic exposure to tn f on the small intestinal architecture. Tnf has been shown to be important in paneth cell granule release in adult intestine. However, the effect of either acute or chronic tnf on paneth cells from immature intestine is less well described. To examine this we treated mice with acute , brief , or chronic Tnf exposures and quantified the number of granule containing Paneth cells. Tnf mediates distinct physiological effects through two separate transmembrane receptors, tnfr1 and tnFr2. Tnf had little effect on the most immature intestine ( p0) despite having similar levels of tn fr1. This was similar to our data regarding tnf effects on goblet cells   and correlates clinically with a lack of development of nec during extremely premature ages. Chronic exposure to tnf induced villus blunting at p14, p21, and p28 mice. However, p14 and p21 mice had significantly increased villus area and epithelial cell counts with this exposure. This suggests a conformation change from thin long villi to shorter , wider villi in the face of chronic inflammation. Our recently proposed model of nec hypothesizes that bacteria invade the intestinal tissue principally through the crypts, rather than through the villus tips as previously thought. In this model , tnf - induced blunting caused by feeding - induced or other chronic inflammation could subsequently decrease the distance between the luminal contents of the intestine and the lamina propria. This shortening of distance would greatly increase the ability of bacteria to reach the crypt and infiltrate the intestine.',\n",

Data on alcohol consumption and anti - craving medication use were recorded at discharge as well as during the time of follow- up at each outpatient clinic visit. Treatment with anti- craving medications and necessary psychological interventions was discussed with each patient and their care takers by a psychiatric expert. The adherence to medication was assessed at every follow - up visit through patients self - report, medication dairy , and simplified medication adherence questionnaire ( smaq) A total of 102 patients with a mean ( standard deviation ) age of 41.17 ( 9.8 ) years constituted the study group. acamprosate was prescribed as an anti - craving medication in 77 patients ( 75.49% ) both during hospital stay and at discharge with median interquartile dose range of 1332 and 1998 mg / day. disulfiram was prescribed in 6 ( 5.88% ) patients at a dose of 125 - 500mg / day and had 100% adherence over 12 weeks. During a 12-week follow - up period, 57 ( 55.89% ) of patients reported to have taken 100% of the prescribed doses of anti- craving medications at any point of time. The number of patients who reported for follow - up reduced significantly ( p < 0.001 ) from 70 ( 68.6% ) at the first visit to 19 ( 18.65%) at the fourth visit. The analysis of adherence to anti - craving medications by patients self - report , through medication diary and smaq scores did not show statistically significant difference in the levels of adherence. apsed ; and by 12 week follow - up , 49 ( 48.03% ) patients had the first drink and 44 ( 43.17% ) Patients of younger age group ( odds ratio = 1.05 95% [ 1.01 - 1.09 ] ; p < 0.01 ) to be significantly less adherent to anti - craving medications. The extent of adherence varied from highest with disulfiram to moderate among naltrexone and acamprosate groups. adults and elderly > 40 years were found to be more adherent compared to patients < 30 years of age. The use of anti - craving medications induces abstinence and underscores the need to enhance treatment adherence through motivation. The adherence to anti - craving medications in the present study was similar to the previous studies with a lower rate of relapse ( 30% ) compared to studies where 50% of the patients relapsed within 3 months of treatment. The relapse rates were minimal among patients taking acamprosate raising concern over its efficacy in reducing craving effects. A recent report by steven has shown the influence of group therapy aimed at personality traits among alcohol dependents. High - risk teenagers are more likely to progress to risky drinking behavior. This study is one of the few that has provided a comprehensive overview of patterns of anti - craving medications prescribed in a tertiary care setup. The present study has quantified anti - craving medication adherence rates to assist in the identification of determinants of adherence among alcohol - dependent patients. The association between nonadherence and its impact on clinical outcome , re - hospitalization , and quality of life was not assessed in this study. This study is one of the few that has provided a comprehensive overview of patterns of anti- craving medications prescribed in a tertiary care setup. More comprehensive , larger , and long - term studies are necessary to examine the adherence pattern to other anti - craving agents to evaluate the potential for their safety and improved efficacy. The findings indicate the need for appropriate pharmacological as well as suitable nonpharmacological intervention to achieve improved rate of abstinence with a decreased rate of relapse.',\n",
       " 'Upjo is the most common cause of prenatal hydronephrosis and occurs sporadically in 1 in 7501500 live births. The left side is affected in approximately two thirds of patients and is bilateral in 1046% of cases. laparoscopic pyeloplasty has been evolving in order to achieve the same results as open surgery with lower rates of morbidity and complications. After general anesthesia , the patient is placed at 45 degrees with the lateral opening centered on the operating table. The colon is dissected along the avascular toldt line and rejected medially to expose the homolateral ureteropelvic junction ( upj ) The mobilization of the upj should be done with great care , identifying the possible existence of polar vessels. Laparoscopic reconstructive surgery is still in an early stage , although the first reports date back to the 90s. laparoscopic pyeloplasty has achieved similar results compared to the reference method represented by an open surgery , but offers the advantages of the minimally invasive surgery. There are no randomized controlled studies. Transperitoneal approach is more familiar to most surgeons and offers advantages such as: 1 ) a much wider workspace that would allow easier addition of techniques such as transposition of polar vessels or remodeling of the pelvis. anatomical landmarks allowing better guidance and more easily reproduce the steps of open surgery. the presence of stones is recognized as a complication of the upjo and the diagnosis creates dilemmas regarding treatment. Transperitoneal laparoscopic pyeloplasty has become the gold standard for the treatment of upjo in our department. This is based on the high success rate, short hospital stay and low intra and postoperative complications. The improvement in 3 mm and 5 mm equipment make this technique less invasive in order to obtain better cosmetic results.',\n",

Females were found to have a more positive attitude towards homosexuals vis -  - vis males. The score on sekhq correlated positively with age ( being older entailed greater knowledge ) and inversely with score on ahq ( those having higher knowledge had more positive attitudes) This is the first such effort to study the knowledge and attitude of medical students towards the same in an indian set up. The findings suggest that overall the participants lacked adequate knowledge about homosexuality. western medical school curricula inadequately address and give very less time to the health and sexuality issues of lgbt people. The association of american medical colleges has recommended that medical school curricula ensure that students master the knowledge , skills , and attitudes necessary to provide excellent care for lgbt patients. Female medical students tend to have a more tolerant attitude towards homosexuals, as also substantiated by this study. Only 41.3% interns opted to participate when approached one to one. The results of this work reflect the attitudes of medical students of a single medical teaching institute of india. The art of medicine depends on the ability to acknowledge and respect these differences and treat every patient as an individual. medical students need to be trained to maintain a non - homophobic attitude.\",\n",
       " 'Reverse shoulder replacement surgery is increasing in prevalence due to the advent of better performing , longer lasting implant designs. Even with these improvements , the burden of revision surgery is inevitable, as implants become infected , loosen , or wear. The true compatibility between different reverse shoulder arthroplasty ( rsa ) systems has not been studied. The three - dimensional geometries of the polyethylene inserts from eight different reverse shoulder arthroplasty systems were reconstructed from microcomputed tomography scanning. The analysis process is shown visually in figure 2. The maximum absolute deviation ( either positive or negative ) between the two surfaces was computationally determined.  regions of interest were selected from the articular surface , the rim , and the backside surface. The maximum amount of deviation was visualized within those structures. descriptive statistics were calculated for the maximum intersystem surface deviation and the intrasystem manufacturing variability. differences between implants and regions ofinterest were compared using a one - way anova with tukey post hoc test. The articular surfaces of the same - sized polyethylene inserts from the 8 rsa systems tested in this study were found to be highly compatible. The magnitude of deviations between implant models was on average 60 m , roughly the thickness of a strand of human hair. There was no difference ( p = 0.38 ) in deviation magnitude based on the location of the measurement ( articular surface, rim , or backside surface ) Many of the implant systems have different rim geometries which are an additional variable and could potentially have an effect on edge wear and impingement. The glenospheres offered by different manufacturers were also not examined. Although it is not the purpose of this paper to make surgical recommendations , our findings suggest that revision surgeons can theoretically interchange same - sized implant components.',\n",

       " 'Resistance training is good for adults health regardless of age. World health organization and multiple national guidelines specifically include resistance training in their recommended physical activity guidelines. Fewer than 15% of older people participate in resistance training twice a week ( the minimum guideline recommended frequency) Barriers to participating include health issues, pain, tiredness or fatigue, lack of social support , and a lack of available exercise facilities. The aim of this study was to identify the reasons why older people who had been participating in a resistance training program chose to discontinue participation. The managers from 15 gymnasiums advised the number of members who had ceased participation in their living longer living stronger resistance training programs. due to confidentiality requirements , the managers could not provide actual contact details of these former participants to the research team. The questionnaire was based on eliciting responses which would explain the reasons why participants no longer attended the resistance training program. A combination of open and closed questions ( likert scales ) were utilized to avoid bias associated with checklists and to ensure opportunity for maximal responses. The qualitative data derived from the open - ended responses were analyzed using inductive content analysis. This was a cross - sectional descriptive study in which participants were surveyed by mail. inclusion criteria were people aged 60 years who had been attending a structured resistance training program.

The reasons given by those not interested in returning were time, not suitable, boring ( waiting for machine and no interaction ) , cost , attending gym elsewhere , and not interested. Most commonly reported reasons were the result of injury or illness. Physical activity and resistance training for improving strength can assist the older person to return to better health and fitness at a faster rate. Fitness centers and other health professionals should be aware that this may occur and provide regular advice and support. It is also recommended that facilities provide screening for past injuries to reduce the likelihood of previous injuries reoccurring. Over 65% of the people were keen to return to the program so a personalized phone call or written invitation may well be a means of easily getting these people to return. Some of the participants identified issues with the gymnasium or fitness center programs as being the reason(s) they stopped participating. Fitness facilities staff often put sessions for older people in off - peak times ( late morning , middle of the day ) thinking older people can attend at any time. The number of older people participating in the recommended minimum two resistance training sessions a week is currently fewer than one in six. This needs to increase so more older people can experience some of the many benefits that have been shown to be associated with resistance training. information for resistance training providers running programs for older people is essential if this needs to be achieved.',\n",

All subjects had normal or corrected - to - normal vision and provided written informed consent. Four subjects participated in nioi measurements only. A single - channel near - infrared spectroscopy ( om-100a , shimadzu co. , japan ) was used to monitor changes in concentrations of hb species during the flash - photo stimulation. pixel size of the nioi was estimated to be 20  20 mm at a source - detector distance of 27 mm. a 1.5 t mri scanner ( magnetom vision ; siemens , germany ) was Used to obtain blood oxygen level - dependent contrast functional images. A craniotomy ( 4  5 mm ) was performed on the left hemisphere and the dura mater was removed to expose the somatosensory cortex. A pair of needle electrodes was inserted underneath the skin of the plantar and ankle region in the contralateral hindlimb. The posterior tibial nerve ( in part the peroneal nerve ) was electrically stimulated with a rectangular pulse of 3.8 ma intensity and 0.5 msec duration at 5 hz. Four of the six subjects participated in nioi measurements only. fluorescence associated with membrane potential changes was measured with a high - speed ccd imaging system. 84 images were acquired at 2 msec intervals , and 21 series of time - course images were averaged. all subjects had normal or corrected - to - normal vision and provided written informed consent.

A black and white annular checkerboard , with a central fixation point and gray background , was used as the visual stimulus. A 16 -channel near - infrared optical imaging system was used to obtain images of changes in concentration of hemoglobin ( hb ) species in the occipital cortex. oxy - hb ) from the control conditions were calculated based on a modified lambert - beer law using the extinction coefficient of chromophores reported by matcher et al. A 1.5 t mri scanner ( magnetom vision ; siemens , germany ) was used to obtain blood oxygen level - dependent contrast functional images. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with our institutional guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. Male wistar rats weighing 190220 g were purchased from slc ( shizuoka , japan ) and allowed free access to food and water. The exposed cortex was stained with a voltage - sensitive dye jpw-1114 ( molecular probes , usa ) ( 0.5 mg / ml for 90 min ) . The hindlimb was electrically stimulated 21 times with a rectangular pulse of 3.8 ma intensity and 0. 5 msec duration at 5 hz. A craniotomy ( 4  5 mm ) was performed on the left hemisphere and the dura mater was removed to expose the somatosensory cortex. A pair of needle electrodes was inserted underneath the skin of the plantar and ankle region in the contralateral hindlimb. The posterior tibial nerve ( in part , the peroneal nerve ) was electrically stimulated with a rectangular pulse of 3.8 ma intensity and 0.5 msec duration at 5 hz. Fig. 1 shows the hemodynamic responses measured using nioi and/or fmri in human occipital cortex during visual stimulation. using flash - photo stimulation , the hb species concentrations measured with nioI increased from their basal levels. But the increases were minimum at a temporal frequency of 8 hz ( fig . this result was the opposite to results obtained using pet   or f mri ) erboard stimulation ( with the eyes open ) it increased above the basal level. The results suggest that there are physiological requirements for the dissociation of stimulus - induced responses of rcbf and rcbv above a certain level of neuronal activity. If the above dissociation phenomenon applies generally to any type of regional brain activation , it should occur regardless of stimulus type, cortical area, or animal species. Fig. 2c shows an absorbance change at a wavelength of 577 nm ( a577 ) , which mainly reflects [ oxy - hb ] , indicating that the change inrcbf spread beyond the hindlimb area at 6 sec after stimulus onset. This wide distribution of cbf correlated well with the widespread increase in intravascular po2 measured using albumin - bound oxygen - sensitive phosphorescence dye. The somatosensory area could be divided into the following four regions : upper right, predominantly hindlimB area; lower right, mainly motor area; upper and lower left, predominantly trunk area. The dissociative response betweenrcbf and rcbv in the human visual cortex ( fig . 1 ) also occurred in the somatosensory cortex of rats in response to different stimuli. Figure 4a shows changes in the blood flow rate and diameter of the pial arterioles supplying the blood to the hindpaw area. Blood flow and diameter of vessel b showed long - lasting increases, probably due to the metabolic effect of the neuronal activation in the hindpaw area. The change in blood flow in vessel c was almost the same as that in vessel b. This suggests that vessel c plays an active role as an \" escape route \" to prevent excess o2inflow into vessel b and the activated area. Fig. 1 shows stimulus - induced changes in pial arteriolar blood flow and diameter in the somatosensory cortex. We found that changes in blood flow during brain activation are not tightly regulated to supply only to an the activated area. This loose regulation serves to prevent intense functional hyperemia and excess o2 inflow into the focallyactivated area.  o2 inflow may increase to undesirable levels in the activated area. This could lead to the production of harmful reactive oxygen species resulting in accumulation of neuronal damage. This research was supported by the breakthrough 21 project of the ministry of post and telecommunications of japan and grants - in - aid from the nissan science foundation of Japan.',\n",

       " 'The hallmark of amyloid aggregation is conversion of otherwise soluble proteins into -sheet conformations that locate extracellularly, in the cytoplasm or in the cell nucleus. The role of nuclear protein aggregates in disease pathology is still unknown. Their assumed function ranges from being cytotoxic to benign or even neuroprotective. The term amyloid currently designates proteinaceous deposits that are defined by one or more histochemical and biophysical features. These features include an ultrastructure of long, unbranched fibrils of approximately 10 nm in width. In vitro characterization of amyloids fiber structure has largely progressed by usage of high - resolution structural studies. formation - specific antibodies , peptides and luminescent compounds have proven useful to monitor amyloid distribution in fixed and living specimens. methods for the discrimination of specific fibrillation intermediates in vivo are still in their infancy. nuclear huntingtin occurs as an early pathological hallmark 12 wk before any murine phenotypes such as brain or body weight loss. degenerative polyq ( cag ) expansion diseases and respective animal or mammalian cell culture models. 20s , 20s proteasome subunits; 19s , 19s prote asome regulator subunits. 11s , 11s\\xa0proteasome\\xa0regulator subunits ; ar , androgen receptor; atxn-1 , ataxin-1 ; atxN-3 , atxin-3 ; atXn-7 , atXin-7. Nis may serve recruitment of excess , mutated , or misfolded nuclear proteins to their degradation. Neurons have different capacities to clear mutated huntingtin and those with greater clearance capacities live longer. In this respect nis may have a protective function by sequestering and clearing excess nuclear proteins from the nucleoplasm. Amyloidogenic candidate proteins affected nuclear functions may include ribosome biogenesis, rna processing, chromatin organization, transcription and nuclear structure. This is consistent with the notion that the ability to convert into an amyloid structure is a generic property of polypeptide chains. The amyloid fold is clearly used in a non - disease - associated manner in normal mammalian cell physiology. Proteins containing stable polyq stretches promote polymerization of functional macromolecular complexes. Polyq stretches might act as adaptor motifs that facilitate the formation of the transcription initiation machinery. The critical length of a polyq repeat is defined by additional context. The intrinsic capacity to form organized fibrillar structures with polyq length above a certain threshold disturbs the functional organization of the cell nucleus. A polyp repeat flanking the polyq stretches has been identified in huntingtin that acts as a cis - inhibitor of polyq aggregation. The nucleus establishes itself as a major cellular compartment for protein degradation. 55% of eukaryotic proteins are predicted to contain unstructured protein regions that are intrinsically amyloidogenic. Heat shock proteins in nis and the discovery of proteasomal activity in amylid - like nucleoplasmic protein aggregates is consistent with this idea.',\n",
       " \"alexander disease ( ad) is a fatal and progressive leukodystrophy of the central nervous system. The clinical phenotype of ad has been divided into three types based on age at onset. Typical features of the infantile form occur before 2 yr old and present as progressive macrocephaly, developmental delay, spasticity , and seizures. Ad is a progressive and usually fatal neurological disorder in which the destruction of white matter in the brain occurs. Little information is available on the pathogenesis of ad or how the gfap mutation leads to leukodystrophy. W. stewart alexander reported a boy with a rapidly enlarging head and hydrocephalus who died at 15 months of age. The infantile form of ad is most common ( 8 - 11 ) , and usually becomes apparent during the first two years of life. seizures often appear at an early stage , whereas spastic quadriparesis is less prominent and occurs later. infantile spasms in ad cases are a remarkable presentation , and are rare according to many reports. Ad codes by gene 17q21 's gfap gene. Ad can now be diagnosed in a high percentage of cases by analyzing dna obtained from peripheral blood, which obviates the need for brain biopsy.

       " \"epigenetic aberrations have been well established in cancer1 , 2 and occur in several other diseases including diabetes3, lupus4, asthma5 and a variety of neurological disorders. In cancer , there is a global loss of dna methylation ( hypomethylation ) , particularly in gene bodies and intergenic regions. This is accompanied by increased de novo methylation of many promoters of tumor suppressor and other genes.  monitoring epigenetic changes can be used to measure treatment efficacy and disease progression. epigenetic modifications are somatically heritable yet also reversible , making them good candidates for potential drug treatments. It is possible that cancer cells become addicted to their aberrant epigenetic landscape and , consequently , more sensitive to the epigenetic therapy than normal cells. 5- azacytidine ( 5-aza - cr ; vidaza ) is a nucleoside analog that incorporates into rna and dna and is fda approved to treat high risk myelodysplastic syndromes ( mds ) patients. potential new drugs that can be used in the clinic include zebularine and s110. Azanucleosides act by sequestering dnmt enzymes after incorporation into dna thus leading to global demethylation as cells divide.  methylation induced silencing of cancer - testis antigens can protect cancer cells from being recognized by t cells. demethylating agents can induce the expression of these antigen allowing a reaction by engineered lymphocytes. suggesting that epigenetic therapy can be combined with immunotherapy for better results ( figure 1 )  histone deacetylase inhibitors ( hdaci) can affect acetylation of non - histone proteins, as well as histones. Significant effort is underway to find new molecules that are able to selectively inhibit specific hdacs. The development of specific hDaci combined with a better understanding of the pathophysiology of diseases associated with alterations in hdac will allow more rational therapy and potentially reduce side effects. Lysine specific demethylase 1 ( lsd1) is a promising target for epigenetic therapy. Lsd1 can also demethylate dnmt1 resulting in destabilization and loss of global dna methylation maintenance. gene promoters which are marked by prc2 ( i.e. polycomb target genes ) in embryonic stem cells are more likely than other genes to become methylated in cancer.  dznep depletes cellular levels of prc2 components ( ezh2 , eed and suz12 ) and consequently reduces h3k27me3 levels and induces apoptosis in breast cancer but not normal cells. A subsequent study showed that dzneps also decreased h4k20me3 demonstrating that it lacks specificity and acts as a global histone methylation inhibitor. Several histone methyltransferases and demethylases have also been associated with diseases and could be potential targets for epigenetic therapy. Despite a lack of specificity , hopefully the development of therapeutics that target specific histone modifying enzymes will retain or increase therapeutic success while decreasing side effects. designing personalized cocktails of inhibitors based on an individual 's need may help overcome the potential problems of compensation and resistance. errantly repressed mirnas using epigenetic drugs , replacement gene therapy may also be useful in re - establishing mirna expression. microrna gene therapy has an advantage , over the conventional rnai , in that it is unlikely to generate a strong type i interferon response. mirnas can be generated using these lna modified phosphorothioate oligonucleotides to create lna - antimirs. etic alterations , creating a highly controlled feedback mechanism , making it a suitable target for epigenetic therapy and possibly an epigenetic drug itself. Multiple mirnas that target different steps of an over - active pathway can be combined to increase efficacy. While the unique composition of mirna based therapy provides many benefits , additional research is necessary to determine the best method of delivery and increase mirna stability to ensure efficacy. Early pre - clinical studies alone and combined with other epigenetic therapies are promising. sfrp2 ( a negative regulator of wnt signaling ) expression was re - established in vitro and in vivo in a human colon cancer model following lsd1 and dnmt inhibition. resistance to standard chemotherapy can be established through epigenetic and dna repair mechanisms.  epigenetic therapies are successfully used in the clinic to treat hematological malignancies , however little success has been achieved in treating solid cancers. The recognition of epigenetics as a significant contributor to normal development and disease opens an expanding new avenue for drug discovery and therapeutics.

       " \"Poverty is recognized as one of the most significant determinants of health. Family physicians are well positioned to address these needs from within a patient - centered primary care model and on a population level. A questionnaire was developed including direct and surrogate markers of poverty. Items were selected from previously validated studies or reviewed by a panel of physicians. The study design and questionnaire were approved by the university of british columbia ethics committee. between february and april 2009, questionnaires were completed by primary care patients in waiting rooms of four university - affiliated clinics. Equal samples of rural and urban , poor and wealthy respondents were sought.

Education had no predictive value of respondents ' above or below lico status. The authors favoured sensitivity over specificity in the univariate analysis as it is more useful for family physicians to accurately identify poverty as opposed to ruling out wealth. The best - performing question was do you ( ever ) have difficulty making ends meet at the end of the month ?

In this study , we treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( huvecs) with microcystin - lr to detect the precise effects on ecs proliferation, apoptosis, and tube formation. cytotoxic activity induced oxidative stress was not cleared in vascular ecs yet. Our findings reported that upregulation of ros and activation of nf-b signaling is a critical mode of action of mc - ll for vascular inflammation. Huvecs ( 5  10) were incubated with mc - lr ( 040  m ) in rpmi 1640 medium containing 0.5% fbs for 3 hours at 37c before seeding into the upper chambers. The migrated cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 1% calcein - am.

The percentage of cells apoptotic increased from 5.1  0.6% to 35.8  3.8% after being exposed to 40  m mc - Lr for 24  h. endothelial cell migration is an essential process in angiogenesis. The dcfda ( nonfluorescent in a resting state but fluorescent upon activation by ros ) was used to determine the efficiency of mc -Lr (040 m ) induced ros formation in huvecs.  mitochondrial ros was notably increased in huvecs treated with mc - lr ( 40  m ) compared with the untreated cells. dpi at the dose used in our experiment ( 500  nm ) was found to block nox enzymes. The increased ros production may partially cause the activation of nf-b in cultured cells. Mc - lr inhibited endothelial cell migration and tube formation at concentrations of 1040  m. The percentage of apoptotic cells increased about 10% after mc - ll treated ( 10  m ) . In addition, the percentage of migration cell decreased about 30%.  mc - lr significantly increased the ros production ( figure 5 ) in huvecs. The rosProduction has been linked closely with inflammatory responses [ 11 , 12 ] both of the ro's production and inflammation were potential mediators of vascular diseases. The results of this study demonstrated that mc - Lr induced nf-b activation in huvcs. Tnf- overexpression has been estimated as an injury - related signal in many researches involving inflammation. This study suggested that mc - lr could be very harmful in the vascular inflammatory process and its precise mechanism needs to be further studied. In conclusion , the most major findings of our study proved that mc-lr enhances inflammatory response in huvecs for the first time.\",\n",

The reported agreement between theory and experimental data in   is 15%. Inertial motors were originally designed for low - temperature scanning - probe microscopy ( spm) They are used both to control and vary the distance d between interacting surfaces and their relative orientation. fib is used to precisely weld a flat silicon single crystal at the extremity of an afm cantilever. The sharpness of x - ray diffraction at bragg position is sufficient to control parallelism.  hydrodynamic force with perfect slip boundary conditions   between a flat afm cantilever and a plane substrate.

The experimental set - up developed for the measurement did not offer any misalignment correction. calculated radiative heat transfer between two silicon samples. A cubic like block can be cut and extracted from a wafer and welded at the end of a cantilever. The precision in the angle that can be achieved is in the order of 0.1 deg. This is not enough for interaction measurements in the plane  plane geometry. To control the parallelism between the two surfaces we propose here to use x - ray diffraction onto single crystals. An x - ray beam is impinging on the first. surface of the sample at an angle satisfying the bragg conditions for diffraction. The beam is diffracted again only if the second crystal is orientated so that the. bragg condition is fulfilled. using a single information it is then possible to control both angles (  ,  ) . the precision that can be achieved using such a control procedure is given by the rocking curve of the selected materials. Proposed procedure guarantees a very good alignment between the lattice axes that can not be directly translated to a good surface alignment. coupling optical reflection of a laser beam with diffraction of an x - ray beam will allow determining very precisely the orientation of the surface. If the two samples are cut from the same wafer the mismatch will be the same for both surfaces. The precision in the separation and parallelism between two surfaces that can be obtained by the here proposed p2sfm will allow one to make a reliable measurement of the interactions between two plane surfaces. The precision in parallelism is sufficient to measure also the interaction force that exhibits the strongest dependence on the distance , i.e. , the casimir force. The use of the plane  plane geometry will allow avoiding using the derjaguin approximation ( pfa ) made for the sphere - plane configuration.

They have been suggested to be important players in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and atherosclerosis. In humans, resistin is predominantly detected in the macrophage populating the adipose tissue. intravenous administration of endotoxin in humans markedly increased circulating resistin levels.  resistin 's role as an inflammatory marker in human and rodent physiology has been well documented. Its role in obesity and insulin resistance in humans is still under debate. There have been reports of increased serum resistin levels in individuals with obesity and/or type 2 diabetes. resistin is secreted by the macrophages localizing to the atheromas. The present study examined whether resistin tnf- , il-6 , and il-1 mrna levels from human peripheral mononuclear cells are altered in type 2 diabetes and whether they correlate with circulating resistin levels and with indices of obesity or insulin resistance. Forty eight ( 48 ) women, all premenopausal , aged between 21  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 and 49 years, participated in our study. We developed a quantitative real - time pcr using fluorescently labeled hybridization probes to detect resistin and proinflammatory ( il-1 , tnf- , and il-6 ) mrna expression in human mononuclear cells. The analysis was performed basically with the program oligo 6.0 ( molecular \\xa0 biology insights , cascade , colo , usa) The human housekeeping genes of -actin and porphobilinogen deaminase were used as standards for normalization. The pbgd house keeping gene was chosen for the relative quantification of the il-6 mrna expression because of the very low level of the expression in the calibrator. The second derivative maximum method was used for the determination of the various crossing points ( cps ) of the target and the reference gene in each sample. Il-1 circulating protein levels were measured in the plasma of all women using a. high sensitivity multiplex assay ( xmap technology ) and the fluorescently. labeled microsphere beads. We could not detect il-1 in the majority of our subjects ( in 57% of controls and 55% of dm2 ) making the analysis of circulating il- 1 problematic. circulating levels of resistin ( biovender , canal zone , usa ) and tnf- were measured. Dm2 women had significantly higher waist circumference and lower hdl cholesterol levels compared to the matched controls. resistin mrna expression was easily detected in human mononuclear - monocytic cells in both dm2 and ngt women. No significant differences were observed between the two bmi subgroups. tnf- , il-6 mrNA and il-1 m rna levels were significantly higher ( 10- , 15- , and 10-fold , resp . ) in d m2 women. rna levels correlated positively between them  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 ( r = 0.687 ,    p < .001 ) and also each one of them with the il-1 mrna. levels. circulating resistin correlated positively  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 with mononuclear resistin , il-6 and il- 1 m rna expression. circulating tnf- ,  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0,  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 and  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0- protein levels did not differentiate between the dm2 and the ngt - control women ( table 4)  resistin mrna expression from human peripheral monocyte - enriched mononuclear cells is elevated in type 2 diabetic women, compared to healthy control women. tnf- and il-6 plasma levels also correlated with bmi  and waist circumference, but not with homa - ir, fasting insulin or glucose plasma levels.  resistin mrna levels from human peripheral monocyte - enriched mononuclear cells were higher in the dm2 compared to healthy women. It should be noted that the difference did not reach significance when all patients were grouped together. The putative role of resistin in obesity - induced insulin - induced diabetes is still unclear.  resistin levels are marginally increased in type 2 diabetic women compared to healthy women. resistance was confirmed by studies in rodents demonstrating that administration of recombinant resistin impairs hepatic insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. In humans resistin is barely detectable in adipocytes, and actual resistin mrna levels are much higher in monocytes and macrophages. Tnf- and il-6 plasma levels were also  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 similar between the ngt and the dm2 women of our study. However, their levels are significantly increased in the subgroup of d m2 women with bmi   >   27 compared to ngt. The above discrepancy could be due to the small number of subjects used in the study.  patients can locally produce and secrete increased resistin and cytokine ( il-1 , tnf- , and il-6 ) levels. These may enhance the  inflammatory load and the associated insulin resistance and vascular dysfunction observed in these patients. These patients may also have an increased risk of developing cancer.\",\n",
       " \"Vitamin d deficiency has been classically associated with rickets in childhood and osteomalacia in adults. There is a growing literature that suggests that low vitamin d status may contribute to the development of insulin resistance , hypertension , and the metabolic syndrome. serum 25-hydroxyvitamin d3 ( cholecalciferol) reflects body stores of vitamin d. Data were examined regarding 1630 individuals aged 1219 years who participated in the national health and nutrition examination survey ( nhanes) from 2001 to 2004. Approximately 5000 individuals are surveyed annually , and about half are children and adolescents. adolescents with serum alt  30  u / l were classified as having suspected nafld in analyses where vitamin d was treated as a categorical variable. There is no consensus on optimal concentrations of 25(oh ) d as measured in serum. The prevalence of suspected nafld in adolescents was identified only by serum alt  30. The following exclusion criteria were applied to this sample: positive for hepatitis b or hepatitis c, pregnant, adolescents who had not fasted for at least 6 hours, type 1 diabetes ( defined as adolescents who were taking insulin ) and type 2 diabetes. Suspected nafld was identified in 12.31% of adolescents in the lowest quartile of serum 25(oh)d compared to 6.91% in the second quartile, 6.81% of adolescent in the third quartile , and 7.14% of teenagers in the fourth quartile. Male adolescents were more likely to have suspected nafl than females. Suspected nfld rates increased with higher bmi. Adolescent males were 6.25 times more likely than females to have suspected nafld ( 95% ci 3.5910.92 ) obese adolescents were 11.57 times more Likely to be at risk than normal - weight adolescents. In contrast, serum 25(oh)d was not independently associated with suspectednafld in the multivariate model. In bivariate analyses treating vitamin d as a continuous variable, a lower mean value of serum 25('oh')d was observed in subjects with alt  30. The findings do not indicate an independent association between vitamin d status and suspected nafld , as suggested by alt level. This is true when vitamin d Status was assessed both categorically and as a continuous variable. The method of measuring adiposity ( bmi or waist circumference > 90th percentile ) did not affect the results of these multivariate analyses. hypovitaminosis d was, however, independently associated with suspected nafild in the only multivariate model that did not include either bmi and waist circumference.  serum 25(oh)d was defined as a concentration greater than 15  ng / ml. The current study includes a larger , nationally representative sample of adolescents that more accurately reflect the usa population. Adults with biopsy - proven nafld had higher rates of hypovitaminosis d than matched control subjects. Season exerts major influences on cutaneous vitamin d3 production. photosynthesis of vitamin d is higher with more exposure to uvb sunlight. oral contraceptives use has been associated with higher serum 25(oh)d and may be deserving of investigation in future studies. overweight and obese adolescents are much more likely than normal - weight adolescents to have elevated serum alt.\",\n",
       " 'a 61-year - old man , with no previous history of trauma , was referred to ewha womans university mokdong hospital for further evaluation of left claudication which was appeared a month prior to admission. On physical examination , absence of pulsation at left dorsalis pedis was noted with relatively intact pulsations at left popliteal artery and left femoral artery. Postoperative follow - up ct angiogram showed no residual thrombus in popliteAl artery and no interval aggravation of arteriosclerosis or aneurysmal change. The psa is more prone to arteriosclerosis and vessel wall degeneration. 46.1% to 47% of psa patients present combined aneurismal change with or without thromboembolism. Common manifestations can be summarized as pulsatile, painful buttock mass and lower limb ischemia. The choice of treatment is mainly dependent on the presence of symptoms. lectomy , either by endovascular intervention or open surgical approach. Our patient showed type 2a psa ( complete psa with incompletely developed sfa system ) with distal popliteal thromboembolism. Thromboembolectomy without bypass surgery should be considered as one of strategies in the treatment of symptomatic psa.',\n",
       " 'Chagas disease ( cd) is an infection caused by the parasite trypanosoma cruzi and is transmitted to humans by an insect vector. It produces 14,000 annual deaths in latin america and is a cause of morbidity, work disability, and increased health care costs. Despite the success in parasite and vector control , argentina regularly reports acute cases of cd. In the context of mainly poor rural populations that face several social and economic constraints , it is crucial to trace back the path that allows them to fulfill the main requirement of the sick role. In a study done in colombia the most frequent path was to initially seek care at the most basic level of care which was influenced by insurance coverage and resources. In the united states the absence of insurance restricted care for cd. In mexico , bites by triatomines were considered as normal daily events and only sometimes thought to transmit disease. in bolivia , similarly , one of the main barriers for latino immigrants in europe to access chagas - related care was the lack of awareness of services provided to them. fear related tocd is linked to lack of knowledge of the disease and the treatment process. not recognizing the severe implications of symptoms was also a significant element in delaying or not seeking health care. The study population was from poor rural families with minimal access to water and electricity. most homes were made out of mud with cracks and crevices that were ideal to accommodate t. infestans ( known in argentina as vinchuca ) The average time between the outbreak and the interview was 11 months. At the onset of symptoms, subjects searched for care at different levels of the system. One individual directly attended the hospital due to the absence of a primary health care unit ( phcu) Four dismissed the local phcu as the first line of care , and one was taken to gh by health personnel working in the field where they were diagnosed. Of the 12 individuals that made it to different hospitals for their first consult, 5 were diagnosed with cd and were transferred to gh for treatment. Six cases were transferred directly to gh without diagnosis , with the  presumption  of cd. Five of the cases had a negative view on the care provided by the phcu in regard to the lack of supplies. Of the 14 acute cases , the four that received a misdiagnosis attended diverse hospitals. These wrongfully diagnosed cases returned to their homes and with the persistence of the acute symptoms went back for another consult. The first step for two of them was to attend the phcu while the remaining was unidentifiable. The mother attributed the inflammation of the eye erroneously to an accident involving a nail. She treated him with edible oil, but once the symptoms worsened she searched for help. She went through three different hospitals and a healer and ended up being diagnosed with cd in gh. The suspicion of child physical abuse was the reason this individual had to pass through five steps of seeking diagnosis. The trajectories of the 25 subjects bring to light active health care seeking behaviors , of which there are five identifiable pathways. These pathways include phcus , different levels of hospitals , the referral hospital ( gh ) , and natural healers. The relative socioeconomic conditions of the acute cases studied did not influence the number of steps the households took to seek care. Venezuela the acute - phase patient is only detected by chance or by extending sero - parasitologic diagnosis to people living in the vicinity of an identified acute case. Only one case was detected as a result of a blood extraction campaign at the population level. As the first symptoms appeared , in many cases seeking care was oriented by the expectation of an effective answer from the system.',\n",
       " ' gene - modified tissue engineering bone has great potential for repairing bone defects. bmp2 has the highest osteoinduction activity in vivo among the bmp family members. local implantation of bmp7 results in the repair of critical size defects in long bones, craniofacial bones, and the formation of bony fusion masses in spinal fusions. The other important aspect is the introduction of bioactive cells into the three - dimensional porous scaffold. Adipose tissue was washed three times with 0.1  mol / l phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs , ph = 7.4 ) and then minced finely and digested with collagenase type i at 37c for 60  min. After centrifugation, the resulting pellet was exposed to lysis buffer for 10 minutes to remove red blood cells. The remaining cells were suspended in dmem media supplemented with 10% fbs and 1% penicillin / streptomycin and plated at 1  10  cells / cm on tissue culture dishes. Alizarin red s staining was used to evaluate adscs mineralization on -tcp scaffolds. Forty healthy sprague - dawley rats weighting about 250  g each were divided into four groups for the implantations. At 14 days, total rna was extracted from each group by the trizol method. The relative expression levels of genes were analyzed using the 2 method by normalizing with gapdh.  rats were anesthetized with celiac injections of 10% chloral hydrate ( 3  ml / kg body weight ) , and approximately 2  mm diameter defect was created on the medial femur by an electric drill. radiographs and histomorphology of rat femurs were examined at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after the surgery. The cell proliferation of bmp2/adscs, bmp7/ adscs , and bMP2 + bMP7/ad scs attached onto -tcp scaffolds was determined by the picogreen dsdna assay. At day 14 after cell seeding, the mrna - relative expression of osteogenic marker genes alp , opn , and oc in bmp2 + bmp7/adscs group was higher than those of control group. A 2  mm - diameter defect was created on the femur middle. Lentiviral vectors - based ex vivo gene therapy has been developed for bone regeneration. lentiviral vector can transduce both dividing and nondividing cells and incorporate into the host genome. -tcp shows excellent osteoconductivity and biocompatibility , and its biodegradation rate could be easily controlled. Heterodimeric bmps can increase biological activity  and facilitate more rapid bone regeneration in better quality. In the present study , in vitro results indicated that adscs co - expressing bmp2 and bmp7 on -tcp scaffolds exhibited a higher degree of osteogenic differentiation compared to those expressing individually bMP2 andbmp7. In vivo experiment demonstrated that the bmp 2 + bmp 7/adscs group implanting present faster and more effective osteogenesis.',\n",
       " \"although cardiac arrest and death rarely occur during the perioperative period , these events represent the worst patient outcomes. A past study of our institution reported overall and anesthesia - related mortality rates of 21.97 and 1.12 per 10,000 anesthetics , respectively. We hypothesized that identifying and controlling risk factors and improving healthcare conditions would improve anesthesia care and , consequently, improve surgical patients outcomes.  unesp hospital is a public tertiary teaching hospital with 450-beds with a catchment of 2 million people that perform approximately 7000 surgeries per year on people of all age groups. The hospital has 15-bed neonatal , 10-bed pediatric , and 37-bed adult intensive care units. anesthesia care is provided by full - time faculty anesthesiologists. The mortality rates ( expressed per 10,000 anesthetics ) and 95% confidence intervals ( cis ) were compared with  test ( ie , sex ) or tukey 's test for multiple comparisons among proportions. The factors predicting perioperative mortality were analyzed with multivariate forward stepwise logistical regression. The majority of deaths occurred in the or ( 96.6% ) compared with the or. Mortality rates varied according to asa physical status , surgery procedures , and type of anesthesia. Highest estimated mortality rates occurred in multiple surgeries performed under the same anesthetic technique. The patient 's disease or condition was the most important triggering factor for mortality ( 86.4% of the perioperative deaths ) , followed by surgery - related ( 13.6%) In 55,002 anesthetized patients there was no perioperative death in patient with asa i physical status. neonates , infants , and older patients continue to exhibit the highest perioperative mortality rates. The current anesthesia - related ( zero per 10,000 anesthetics ; 95% ci : 0.00.0 ) and surgery - related mortality rates were lower than those previously reported. Although our peri operative mortality rate was lower ( 28.2% ) than those reported in the 2000s , it was higher than those reports in the last years. Cardiac surgery had a perioperative mortality risk factor that was 42-fold higher than noncardiac surgeries in patients younger than 18 years old. The findings demonstrate a persistent need to improve the quantity and quality of resource utilization and healthcare access in brazil and other low and medium human development countries. The mortality risk conferred by surgery in the current study was 2.7-fold lower compared with the previous study. A ruptured aneurysm was the first important cause of perioperative mortality in older patients, whereas complications associated with cardiac surgery were an important cause in children and older patients. Despite the healthy trend of higher life expectancy of the women, our findings corroborated with other studies demonstrated no evidence of sex predisposing peri operative death. Despite the improvements achieved in patient anesthesia safety, the perioperative mortality rate of 16.0 per 10,000 anesthetics is higher than the rates in developed countries. significant predictors of peri operative mortality included asa , age ( with neonates , infants , and older patients at a greater mortality risk ) , and emergency , cardiac or vascular surgeries.\",\n",
       " 'The \" huntington protocol \" was adopted for the counselling of unaffected individuals who wanted to know whether they had inherited a familial brca1/2 mutation. The guidelines recommend that individuals at risk who participate in predictive testing programmes are seen for two to four counseling sessions , spread over a 3-month period. predictive testing requires informed consent by the individual at risk and the provision of psychological support. Several psychological studies have now been conducted to determine the psychological impact of genetic susceptibility testing for brca1/2. No unusually high levels of psychiatric disorder were detected in a group of 315 unaffected individuals from families with a known mutation of brca 1/2 . In another study it was concluded that of 211 women with a previous history of breast and/or ovarian cancer and 253 unaffected women at risk remarkably few women reported psychological distress. Women reporting more psychological distress at the time of blood sampling generally continue to report higher distress levels after receiving the result. following testing about half of the mutation carriers and a third of the non - carriers were found to have asked for professional support for psychological problems. Unmarried women seeking genetic counselling for a family history of breast / ovarian cancer reported more distress than married women in one study. A second session with the counsellor can be offered when unanticipated information or facts emerge in the first session. Several centres have already adopted a shortened protocol for counselees who apply for brca1/2 genetic susceptibility testing. Aktan - collan et al evaluated a shortened Protocol for predictive testing for hnpcc that consisted of two sessions and no provision of additional psychological support.',\n",
       " 'The troncular anesthetic technique to the inferior alveolar nerve ( ian ) or  halstead technique is the block of the ian and lingual nerve through the deposit of local anesthetic in the pterygomandibular space.

The aim of this article is to present an unusual case of tr oncular anesthesia of the\\xa0ian that included temporary ischemia in the branches of the maxillary artery. The dentist injected approximately 0.3 ml of anesthetic solution into the mouth nerve and then penetrated with the needle into delicate tissue 25 mm approximately until osseous contact.

       " \"This case report describes the surgical technique used and clinical outcome of glenoidectomy on a 15 -year - old neutered female cat. The cat had a comminuted fracture of the  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 right glenoids and scapular neck secondary to a gunshot injury that was treated with the procedure. Good clinical outcomes are possible with removal of theglenoid for treatment of comminuting fractures of the scapulohumeral joint. The cat was sedated with butorphanol ( 0.2 mg / kg ) and midazolam (0.2mg / kg) intramuscularly prior to establishing intravenous ( iv ) access. radiographs revealed a severely comminuted fracture of the scapular neck and glenoid with lateral displacement. There was a marked increase in soft tissue opacity within the right axilla and subscapular space with mild subcutaneous emphysema. The cat was ambulatory with toe - touching to non - weight - bearing lameness in the right forelimb. examination performed at the time of admission was similar to that  reported by the primary care veterinarian earlier that day. Given the anaemia and inadequate analgesia, further in - hospital supportive care with packed red blood cell transfusion was planned. The cat was discharged for the weekend the next day with re - presentation scheduled for the start of the following week. The cat was premedicated with methadone ( 0.3 mg / kg i m ; troy laboratories ) and general anaesthesia was induced with diazepam and ketamine. The cat was positioned in left lateral recumbency and a 15 cm lateral incision was made over the right scapula spine and then distal over the glenohumeral joint. The suprascapular and axillary nerve could not be visualised owing to extensive soft tissue damage around the scapular neck. The hamate and suprahamate processes of the acromion ( origins of the deltoid muscles ) were attached to the scapular spine with a fine fibrous adhesion. The humeral head was displaced medially and ventrally , and was manipulated back into a normal position with bone - holding forceps. A muscle flap was created from the caudal aspect of the supraspinatus muscle by incising it parallel to its fibres. A 2 cm incision was made along the epaxial longissimus thoracic muscles over right side of t13. blunt dissection was made through the muscle to retrieve a metallic fragment of bullet. postoperative radiographs confirmed the removal of the majority of the fragmented glenoid and scapula. A single sliver of bone was observed caudolateral to the humeral head of the deltoid. The cat recovered from anaesthesia with a cri of fentanyl ( 13 g / kg / h ) without complication. This report describes the surgical technique and clinical outcome of a cat that had a complete glenoidectomy performed to treat a comminuted fracture secondary to a gunshot injury of the distal scapula. The cat's right forelimb appeared moderately hypertrophied compared with the contralateral limb. At the 6 month recheck, there was marked atrophy of the supra- and infraspinatus muscles. The literature suggests that expected limb use after partial scapulectomy in cats and dogs should be good to excellent when there is preservation of neurological function. The relative contribution of these to glenohumeral stability in the cat has not been demonstrated. The transarticular tendons ( specifically the supraspinatus , biceps brachii and subscapularis ) are active stabilisers of the glen ohumeral joint and require energy to contract and relax. No crepitus or pain was appreciated in the right shoulder at the 3 week recheck. The use of a muscle sling in excisional arthroplasties remains controversial. The surgical technique of glenoidectomy is a viable alternative to amputation in cats with normal neurovascular supply to the affected limb.\",\n",
       " 'High - mobility group box-1 ( hmgb1) is a nonhistone dna - binding nuclear protein. It has been implicated in diverse intracellular functions, including the stabilization of nucleosomal structures and the facilitation of gene transcription. necrotic cell death can result in passive leakage of hmgB1 from the cell as the protein is then no longer bound to dna. It can be actively secreted by different cell types, including activated monocytes and macrophages.  extracellular hmgb1 plays a key role in the development of neuronal injury through microglial activation and proinflammatory mediators. glycyrrhizin ( ga ) has long been known to exhibit glucocorticoid - like anti - inflammatory actions by inhibiting 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. more recently , ga has also been shown to bind to and inhibit chemoattractant , mitogenic , and cytokine - like activities of hmgB1. In this study , we explored the hypothesis that h mgb1 play a pathogenetic role in mediating diabetes - induced retinal neuropathy. to test this hypothesis , we investigated the expression of the neurodegeneration medi Adult male sprague dawley rats of 8 - 9 weeks of age ( 200220  g) were overnight fasted and streptozotocin ( stz ) 55  mg / kg in 10  mm sodium citrate buffer , ph 4.5 ( sigma , st . rats were considered diabetic if their blood glucose was greater than 250 mg / dl. After 4 weeks of diabetes, the rats were euthanized by an overdose of chloral hydrate. Retina was isolated and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80c to be analyzed by western blot analysis or biochemical assay. The tissue lysate containing 4050  g of protein was separated on 10% or 12% sds - polyacrylamide gels and was transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in tbst ( 20  mm tris - hcl , ph 7.6 , 136  mm nacl , and 0.1% tween-20 ) for detection of hmgb1 , phospho - erk1/2 , synaptophysin , cleaved caspase-3 , th , glo1 , and gs. The membranes were washed four times with tbs - t ( 5  min each ) for synapt The immunoreactivity of bands was visualized on a high - performance chemiluminescence machine ( g : box chemi - xx8 from syngene , synoptic ltd . cambridge , uk ) and quantified by densitometric analysis using image processing and analysis in genetools. The blots were stripped and detected with a mouse monoclonal anti--actin antibody. The fold change in gene expression relative to normal was calculated using the ddct method. The body weights of the diabetic rats were lower and their blood glucose levels were more than fourfold higher compared with age - matched normal control rats. western blot analysis demonstrated significant upregulation of hmgb1 expression in diabetic retinas compared to nondiabetic retinas. cleaved caspase-3 , the apoptosis executer enzyme, was significantly upregulated in diabetic rats compared with nondi diabetic controls. There was no significant difference in serum levels of hmgb1 between rats intravitreally injected with hmgB1 ( 135.64  14.38 ) and normal rats ( 134.88  11.01 ) ( p = 0.225 ) In the same retinal samples, h mgb1 injection resulted in a 76% increase in erk1/2 activation and a 31% decrease in cleaved caspase-3 expression. In the ga - fed diabetic rats, the decrease in synaptophysin , th , gs , and glo1 caused by diabetes was attenuated by about 58% , 55% , 79% , and 53% , respectively. The expression of hmgb1 mrna in diabetic rats was increased by about 4-fold compared to the retinas of nondiabetic rats. intravitreal injection of h mgb1 resulted in increased hmgB1 m rna expression by about 5-fold. diabetes induced significant downregulation of synaptophysin , th , gs , and glo1 in the retina of rats. 1 month of diabetes decreases retinal expression of synaptophysin. Diabetes - induced degeneration of retinal capillaries can develop independent of neuronal loss. Glo1 overexpression in diabetic rats prevents hyperglycemia - induced formation of precursor methylglyoxal ( mg ) Hmgb1 is massively released immediately after an ischemic insult and that it subsequently induces neuroinflammation in the postischemic brain. Intravitreal administration of hmgb 1 induced downregulation of synaptophysin, th, gs, and glo1. These findings suggest that the early retinal neuropathy of diabetes involves the upregulated expression of h mgb1.  intravitreal administration of hmgb1 in normal rats mimics the effect of diabetes. We also showed that the hmgB1 inhibitor ga was effective in preventing diabetes - induced nf-b activation. These findings suggest that activation of h mgb1/rage signaling axis is important in promoting diabetes- induced retinal neuropathy.  ga affords protection in postischemic brain and spinal cord via its anti - inflammatory , antiapoptotic , antiexcitotoxic , and antioxidative effects. inhibiting the release of hmgb1 with constant intake of ga results in less diabetes - induced retinal neuropathy. excessive intake of licorice may cause hypermineralocorticoidism - like syndrome.',\n",
       " \"rapid palatal expansion ( rpe) has been widely used in the field of orthodontics since the mid-1960s for increasing the transverse dimensions of the maxilla in growing patients. conventional rpe can produce unwanted effects in adults such as expansion failure, alveolar bone dehiscence, buccal crown tipping and root resorption. cone - beam computed tomography ( cbct) allows imaging at relatively low radiation dosages and presents a clear view of bony structures with minimal image distortion. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the following null hypothesis : short - term skeletal and dentoalveolar measurements obtained before and after marpe in young adults do not differ significantly. The cbct records of 19 patients with maxillary constriction who had undergone maxillary expansion by marpe between january 2012 and october 2013 were retrieved. Four orthodontic miniscrews with a collar diameter of 1.8 mm and length of 7 mm were placed at the center of each helical hook ( figure 1).12 maxillary expansion was initiated on the day after marpe device placement. The appliance was activated at a rate of one turn per day ( 0.2 mm per turn ) until the required expansion was achieved. Two coronal scans were obtained perpendicular to the midsagittal plane, passing through the buccal / mesiobuccal cusp tips and furcations of the maxillary first premolars and molars. For measurement of nasal cavity and basal bone widths, the anterior - most slice showing the entire palatal roots was selected ( figure 5) The mean values of the two measurements were used for statistical analyses. 18 of the 19 patients were excluded on the basis of the following exclusion criteria : failure of opening of the midpalatal suture, systemic diseases, craniofacial anomalies, and history of orthodontic treatment. 14 patients with a mean age of 20.1  2.4 years ( range , 1626 years ) were retrospectively enrolled in the study. The marpe device was fabricated by modifying the conventional hyrax - type rpe device. During image acquisition, the patients were seated upright with the frankfort horizontal plane parallel to the floor and the patient 's head stabilized by an ear rod. Patients were asked to open their mouth slightly during image acquisition to prevent overlapping of the maxillary and mandibular teeth. The images were imported as digital imaging and communications in medicine ( dicom ) files using invivo5 software ( anatomage , san jose , ca , usa ) and reoriented.  measurement of nasal cavity and basal bone widths. anterior - most slice showing the entire palatal roots of the maxillary right first premolars and molars was selected. interdental angle was defined by connecting the central fossa and palatal root apex. buccal bone thickness and alveolar height were measured on the right and left sides. mean values of the two measurements were used for statistical analyses. comparison of skeletal and dentoalveolar measurements before and after marpe was performed using paired t - tests. In the present study , we evaluated skeletal and dentoalveolar changes after marpe in young adults with transverse maxillary discrepancy using cbct. marpe effectively achieved dento alveolar as well as skeletal expansion by separation of the midpalatal suture. Despite the decrease in thickness and height of the buccal alveolus and the buCCal tipping of the maxillary first molars, the changes observed after mar pe were similar to those observed after conventional rpe. The bone - borne nature of the marpe device can result in skeletal and alveolar expansion in young adults despite the increased resistance of the midpalatal and circumaxillary sutures. The expansion of the nasal cavity was more evident and would have resulted in increased air flow and improved nasal breathing. The amount of expansion was similar between the anterior and posterior regions at the crown ( ipmw and imw ) and alvesolar crest ( prosthion and ectocanine ) levels. First molar exhibited similar or slightly greater increases in imw, ipmw, nasal cavity, and basal bone widths than the first premolar. Higher density of buccal cortical bone in maxillary canine and premolar regions might have resulted in the greater buCCal inclination of the first molar. Tipping movements might cause changes in alveolar bone.  marpe can be an effective treatment modality for the correction of maxillary transverse deficiency in young adults through separation of the midpalatal suture.

       " 'meningiomas account for 1320% of all intracranial tumors and of these 0.53% occur in intraventricular location. clinical features and imaging are not characteristic to identify these lesions preoperatively. The importance of preoperative diagnosis lies in predicting the consistency and vascularity of tumor. A 47 -year - old female presented with a headache and neck pain of 1-year duration along with gait disturbance and recurrent falls of 4-month duration. On examination computerized tomography ( ct ) scan showed an iso - hyperdense mass lesion in the fourth ventricle which was heterogeneously enhancing on contrast. She underwent a right retromastoid suboccipital craniotomy , c1 arch excision and gross total excision of the meningioma. Meningiomas arising in the ventricular system without dural attachment is extremely rare , with an incidence of 0.53% among all intracranial meningiomas and still rare are these located in the fourth ventricle. The patients are asymptomatic at follow - up of 9 months. Fvm is unlikely to be considered in differential diagnosis of fourth ventricular tumors in adults because it has no characteristic imaging features on ct scan or mri. metastasis, pilocytic astrocytoma , medulloblastoma , ependymoma , and choroid plexus papilloma are usually considered as differential diagnosis. Meningiomas which occur primarily in the fourth ventricle are very rare and this only the second report from india. Total removal of the lesion with good microsurgical technique is the standard and has a good outcome with low operative risk. understanding the clinical features and a careful preoperative radiological examination is required to differentiate this tumor from more commonly occurring lesions.',\n",
       " 'no clear etiology has been associated with most ependymomas to date. There is increased incidence of spinal intramedullary ep endymomas in patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 ( nf2) However, many of these tumors, especially those that occur intracranially, do not harbor n f2 mutations. Several studies have disqualified the Sv40 tumor virus as a causative agent of ependymoma. The strongest opposing argument is based on epidemiologic studies that showed no increase in the incidence of ep endymoma and other cancers in the years following the massive introduction of Sv40-contaminated polio vaccines into the human population. Cgh analysis done by dyer et al. on pediatric intracranial ependymomas. tumors can be subdivided into three distinct subgroups based on the number of chromosomal anomalies detected per tumor. tumors with a balanced genetic profile make up the balanced group, which is significantly associated with an infant age at diagnosis. The second  structural  group shows few and mainly partial genomic imbalances. lastly , the third numerical  group exhibits 13 or more primarily whole chromosome imbalance similar to those often seen in adultEpendymoma. 22 and allelic losses on chromosome 22q have been found in numerous studies to be the most common genetic abnormalities in sporadic ependymoma. Initial quests for tumor suppressor genes present on 22q focused on nf2 located at 22q12. mapping of deletions and translocation breakpoints using high - resolution techniques revealed 22pter22q11.2, 22q11 , 22q2112.2 , and 22q13.113.3 to be hotspots. 1q gain is occasionally the only observable alteration , with few other chromosome imbalances detected in ependymomas. Yet , in some cases , it marks tumor recurrence. This suggests the presence of genes located on 1q that may be involved in the initiation , progression , and/or therapeutic resistance ofEpendymoma. efforts have been made to determine the critical region on chromosome 1q for the identification of these crucial genes. Chromosomal aberrations include deletion of chromosomes 6q and 9 and gain of chromosome 7. candidate oncogenes proposed by analyzing recurrent gains on chromosome 7 include egfr ( epidermal growth factor receptor ) at 7p11.2 and twist1 and hdac9 at 7 p21.1. locus 6q25.3 containing the snx9 and synj2 genes was found to be the most frequently deleted.  homozygous deletion spanning the cdkn2a locus at 9q21.3 has been detected and is a characteristic of anaplastic supratentorial tumors. The presence of 6p22-pter and 13q14.3-qter losses predicted significantly reduced survival in intracranial pediatric ependymomas. Highly elevated htert expression has been shown to be associated with ependymoma progression and recurrence. Recently, wong et al. proposed telomerase inhibition as a novel therapy for ep endymoma. Epitomeetics in the form of promoter dna ( cpg ) hypermethylation is an important route by which transcriptional inactivation can be achieved. Hic-1 is a putative tumor suppressor gene. It exhibits hypermethylation and loss of expression in various tumors such as medulloblastoma and gliomas. The ras association domain family 1 isoform a ( rassf1a ) gene has also been found to be frequently silenced by methylation. suarez - merino et al. identified 112 abnormally expressed genes in ependymoma. genes with increased expression included the oncogene wnt5a and several cell cycle, proliferation, adhesion and extracellular matrix genes. genes that were found to be down - regulated included the a / f2-interacting gene schip-1 and the apc - associated gene eb1.  ependymomas are defined by over - expression of numerous hox genes. There is consistent up - regulation of the notch receptors ( notch1/2 ) and ligands ( jagged 1/2 and dll1/3) This is in contrast to fbxw7, which is consistently down - regulated. Deregulated notch signaling is crucial for neural development. Researchers have compared the gene expression profiles of low grade versus high grade ependymomas and primary tumors versus recurrent tumors to better understand the molecular genetics ofEpendymoma progression. palm et al . revealed that who grade 3 anaplastic ep endymomas differed from grade 2 tumors by the over - expression of genes implicated in wnt/-catenin signaling activation. The genes that were significantly down - regulated were metallothionein genes and genes involved in the immune system. The importance of immune function in hindering ependymoma progression and recurrence was also recognized through the study by donson et al. Supratentorial versus infratentorialEpendymomas showed distinct changes in expression profile at recurrence. Research is to determine the normal cell type that gives rise to a particular malignancy. This is a crucial step towards functionally identifying the successive oncogenic events leading to tumor onset and progression. Growing evidence suggests that tumor subgroups may arise due to deregulation of cell signaling pathways. The hox family of transcription factors may be involved in spinal ependymoma development by transforming rgcs in the spinal region. There is evidence that rg - like cells are present not only during development but also persist in the adult cns. thus, these cells may serve as the cells of origin for adult ep endymomas. The gene expression profile of a subset of human supratentorial ep Endymomas was matched with that of embryonic cerebral rgcs from mice. ogenetic studies identified broad chromosomal gains and losses , with loss of 22q being the most common . nf2 is recognized as a putative tumor suppressor gene in spinal ependymomas based on mutational analysis and increased incidence of ependyeoma in patients with nf1 familial syndrome. ependyomas from different regions of the cns are genetically distinct diseases marked by unique gene expression signatures. ymoma research , greater progress is still urgently needed if we are to realize the ultimate goal of improving clinical outcome for patients. Next - generation sequencing technologies and high - throughput techniques for unbiased epigenetic profiling posterior fossa ependymomas in particular deserve our attention. candidate oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes discovered to date should be promptly assessed.',\n",
       " 'bacteria belonging to the burkholderia cepacia complex ( bcc) have emerged as highly problematic opportunistic human pathogens in immunocompromised individuals and in patients with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis. The virulence of the bcc members is variable and b. cenocepacia is the most common species isolated from the respiratory tract of cf patients. bcc strains posses a wide range of virulence factors that are critical for colonization and disease. Three distinct taas are involved in bacterial adherence. These proteins are multifunctional virulence factors involved in several other biological traits of pathogenic gram - negative bacteria. Although it is poorly understood and controversial , taas biogenesis seems to occur dependently of other protein partners ( lehr et al . , 2010 ) Hep_hag and him are short repeat motifs found in bacterial hemagglutinins and invasins. domains that thereby make them good candidates for vaccine development. Several taas have been characterized in terms of function and structure within a large number of bacterial pathogens. Yada from y. enterocolitica has been one of the most extensively studied and is found to display a multifaceted activity during host  pathogen interaction. We have conducted an in silico analysis in completed genomes of bcc members aiming to identify taa - encoding sequences. We focused our analysis on the epidemic strain b. cenocepacia j2315 in which seven taas were annotated. Some bcc genomes contain a large number of taas. These taas may have been acquired by insertions of transposable elements and/or bacteriophages or through horizontal transfer of dna fragments. Whether these taas have redundant or unique functions is an important question that needs to be answered. The genome of b. cenocepacia mc0 - 3 contains the highest number ( 8) and density.  serine - rich repeat proteins have been found only in gram - positive bacteria where they appear to play a decisive role in colonization. The phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the result of the global alignment of the 74 sequences performed by clustalw 2.0.12 ( thompson et al . , 1994 ) Each sequence is identified using the strain abbreviated name composed by the first letter of the genus and the three first letters of the specie. The taas are under - represented in three bcc species, namely b. multivorans, b. dolosa and b. vietnamiensis. The distribution of taas is not species specific. The representatives included in the clusters ii and ii are almost exclusive found in the genomes of the b. cenocepacia strains. In silico analysis, we focused our analysis on the epidemic strain b. cenocepacia j2315 in which seven taas were annotated. Of the seven taa - encoding genes, five were located on chromosome 2 and two on chromosome 3. These observations are consistent with the fact that the chromosomes 2 and 3 contain a large number of virulence genes. chromosome 1 carries the majority of the core functions. Seven taa - encoding genes are found in the genome of the epidemic strain b. cenocepacia j2315. These seven taas are scattered over the phylogenetic tree as follows. analysis of these taa proteins reveals the existence of common complex architectures represented by multi - modular and polyfunctional domains. Given the importance of taas in the virulence of gram - negative pathogens , it is likely that these multifunctional proteins may play decisive roles in b.cenocePacia virulence. A pcr test targeting the taa - encoding gene bcam0224 has been proved to be specific for epidemic b. cenocepacia strains belonging to the et-12 lineage. The deduced protein encoded by bcam224 is composed of 953 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 85 kda and a pi of 4.02. We consider that this novel pcr - based assay may serve as a valuable tool to aid in bcc strain identification. The bcam0224-mutant exhibited attenuated ( 10% ) killing ability in comparison to the wild - type b. cenocepacia k56 - 2. The taa proteins identified in this study are promising targets for future experimental analysis. The research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.',\n",

       " 'Patients with acute coronary syndromes ( acss) have a high risk for developing stent thrombosis ( st) because of the prothrombotic effect of the procedure and the underlying disease. Newer generation agents such as prasugrel and ticagrelor are the first choices of treatment in patients with acss as they provide more active and consistent platelet inhibition. The availability of these drugs is not optimal and clopidogrel is still frequently used. We recruited acs patients with stemi admitted for primary angioplasty in whom coronary intervention with stent implantation was performed and tirofiban treatment was initiated. exclusion criteria were age over 75 years, chronic treatment with thienopyridines, loading dose of clopidogrel lower than 600  mg prior to pci, history of stroke or transient ischemic attack.  platelet aggregation was measured automatically by multiplate device. paired t - tests were used for the comparison of normally distributed continuous variables in the same group between time points. hyperbolic curve fittings to platelet reactivity to time were prepared assuming single ligand  receptor interaction. statistical analyses were performed with graphpad instat 3 version and graphpad prism 6 version statistical packages ( graphpad software, san diego , ca , usa ) The authors of this manuscript have certified that they comply with the principles of ethical publishing. Multiple electrode aggregometry ( multiplate , roche diagnostics gmbh , mannheim , germany ) was used for platelet function assessments. 300  l of whole blood was stirred at 37  c between two platinum wire electrodes set at a fixed distance. for measuring clopidogrel efficacy, adp ( 0.2  mm , roChe ) was Used as agonist agent. efficiency of tirofiban was determined indirectly. Overall platelet reactivity was determined by measuring the area under the curve from the function of impedance to time. Tirofiban effectiveness was measured by trap , while clopidogrel efficiency was monitored by adp administration. mean residual platelet reactivity at the time and 24  h after the termination of tiroFiban administration in patients receiving combined antiplatelet therapy after pci was determined. Tirofiban effectiveness was measured by trap , while clopidogrel efficiency was monitored by adp administration. mean residual platelet reactivity at the time and 24  h after the termination of tiroFiban administration in patients receiving combined antiplatelet therapy. The infarct size at 30 days was smaller when the patients underwent both thrombus aspiration and application of intracoronary iib / iiia inhibitor abciximab. tirofiban administered ( as bolus only or bolus followed by 2-h infusion ) to patients with mi undergoing coronary stenting together with either clopidogrel or prasugrel. High platelet reactivity ( hpr) during clopidogrel therapy indicates persistent response of the p2y12 receptor. observational studies have demonstrated a strong correlation between hpr and recurrent ischemic events in stented patients. hpr detected by an adp - specific laboratory assay for 1 year serves as the condition of the reimbursement of prasugrel in hungary. Adp - receptor - specific residual platelet reactivity is significantly influenced by the presence of concurrent gpiib / iiia inhibitors. Adp receptor blocker clopidogrel is only effective in the npr group of patients. In the hprGroup of patients ( based on hungarian and european consensus recommendation for multiplate electrode aggregometry below 46  u ) , application of clopper is ineffective, thus adequate change in drug therapy is advocated.',\n",

       " \"hepatic infarction is a very rare disease entity and usually occurs in patients who underwent liver transplantation.

       " 'Cataract is the most frequent reason for blindness in children and associated with approximately 5%20% of blindness in childhood in the world. The response of the pediatric anterior capsule to surgical maneuvers differs from adult. The aim of the current study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of vitrectorhexis method for both anterior and posterior capsules combined with anterior vitrectomy. ated fundus examination . mydriatic eye drops ( tropicamide 0.5% and phenylephrine hydrochloride 2.5%) were given every 15 minutes for 3 times beginning 2 hours before surgery. cataract surgeries were performed under general anesthesia , and the same surgical approach was used in each case. A total of 23 eyes of 19 patients ( 8 girls and 11 boys ) were enrolled in the study. sodium hyaluronate ( 1.8% ) was removed by using i / a and stromal hydration was performed with balanced salt solution. intraoperative tear was observed only in one of 23 ( 4.3% ) eyes during anterior capsulotomy. mild anterior chamber reaction was seen in 5 patients operated before 36 months of age. The vitrector handpiece was begun to be used for performing mechanized anterior capsulectomy due to difficulty of manual ccc on the younger children having highly elastic capsule. 18 pairs of postmortem children eyes ( range : 4 days16 years ) underwent pediatric cataract surgery ( with iol implantation ) within a day of enucleation. The development of radial tear was observed in one of 18 children eyes with mechanized capsulotomy. The tear was occurred in a 16 - aged eye. One of the most common and important complications after cataract surgery in children is pco. incidence of pco has been reported from 16% up to 50% at several studies. pco occurs quickly and nearly unavoidable in very young children when the posterior capsule is left intact. Primary posterior capsulotomy and anterior vitrectomy are essential surgical interventions. Pars plicata approach was only used in infancy because pars plana vitrectomy is applicable when the patient is at least a 6-month - old full - term infant. The use of infusion for vitrectorhexis and usage of small amount of ovd only in iol implantation may facilitate removal of inflammatory mediators and lead to less postoperative inflammation.  dual approach using vitrectorhexis and anterior vitrectomy is an easy - to - perform technique that seems safe in the short term in children less than 6 years of age. The main advantages of this technique are to ease both anterior and posterior capsulotomies and possibly the prevention of the development of pco in pediatric cataract cases.',\n",

The most and least commonly used herbs were ginger ( 44.36% ) and tenaadam ( 9.15%) Most pregnant women ( 50.4% ) used herbs compared to other studies performed in developed countries. The possible explanation is probably easy accessibility ( 43.18% ) and less affordability of conventional medicines. raspberry leaf, ginger and chamomile were the most widely used herbal supplements. Only 14.29% of the women reported to have received health advices from healthcare workers. This indicates that healthcare workers play a small role regarding information provision about herbal drugs to patients / customers.

It is characterized by severe nausea and hyperemesis associated with chronic marijuana abuse. The patient could not wait for physical examination, meal , or medication because of obsessive compulsive hot showering. abstinence from marijuana during the hospital stay made the patient s nausea , vomiting , and obsessive warm showering resolve after 3 days. Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome is a new syndrome that causes recurrent abdominal pain and vomiting among some patients. The most intriguing component of the syndrome is the compulsive showering in hot water to relieve the symptoms. Some patients have reported having more than 20 lengthy baths in a day , while others spent 36 hours in the bathroom and applied hot water bottles to the abdomen. 2 cannabinoid hyperemesis should be considered a differential diagnosis among patients with intractable nausea , vomiting , and obsessive hot bathing. with chronic cannabinoid use may contribute to the symptoms. A temporary relief of symptoms may be related to a redistribution of blood flow from the gut to the skin with warm bathing.',\n",

It has been estimated that 50% of the population has persistent plicae after birth. The syndrome is caused by the irritation and resultant inflammatory reaction of the relic. The most frequent complaint was supra - patellar pain and cracking noises following the performance of physical activity of a type or intensity the patient was unaccustomed. The initial treatment for all of these patients was conservative and involved implementing a stretching program for the muscles of the lower extremities. Eight patients eventually underwent knee surgery because conservative treatment had not led to a resolution of their symptoms. All of the patients were followed up with by the present author for at least two years after the onset of their Symptoms. The synovial plica of the knee was the first described by iino3 in 1939. The plica is an embryonic relic that is present in about 50% of the population. There are no race-related differences in the prevalence of the plicae. within our setting, 48% of cadavers they examined had supra- or mid - patellar plicAE.  pathological synovial plica syndrome is caused by excessive or inappropriate use of the knee. About 50% of the population has plicae and they are almost always asymptomatic.

       " \"nk cells are effector lymphocytes of the innate immune system that control several types of tumors by limiting their growth and dissemination. In vitro studies using cells from humans and several other mammalian species, as well as in vivo studies in mice and rats, suggest a role for nk cells in the control of tumor development in mice. Nk cells are mediators of the antitumor effects of several recombinant cytokines. Low nk cell activity is associated with increased cancer risk in adults. The beneficial role of nk cells in controlling human malignancies stems from clinical studies of leukemia patients who received alloreactive nk Cells in the course of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Tumor - infiltrating lymphocytes ( tils ) in various human cancers has been an issue of great interest. Several studies have shown that the infiltration of lymphocytes significantly correlates with a prolonged survival time of patients. typically, nk cells are not found in large numbers in advanced human neoplasms. Tumor - induced alterations of activating nk cell receptor expression may hamper immune surveillance and promote tumor progression. Several authors studied the balance between inhibitory and activating receptors of nk cells that infiltrate tumors. In some cases downregulation of activating receptors and in others, overexpression of inhibitory ones. In a study in metastatic melanoma ( mm ) patients, nk cells presented decreased activity and ifn- production and also had a redistribution of nk cell subsets. There was a decreased cd161 and nkg2d activating receptors and an overexpressed cd158a inhibitory nK cell receptor. These results are in agreement with another study in mm where a significantly lower percentage of nK cells expressed cd16 and nkp30 activating receptors as compared to healthy donors. Although the molecular mechanisms responsible for the reduced receptor expression in pb nk Cells remains elusive. Many mechanisms have been proposed to explain the antitumor activity of unconjugated tumor antigen - specific monoclonal abs ( mabs) abs are linked to immune effector functions by the fc fragment, which is capable of initiating adcc when binding to fc receptors. polymorphisms in the gene encoding fcriii are associated with high response rates to rituximab in patients with follicular non - hodgkin 's lymphoma. Nk cells produce cetuximab - mediated adcc of metastatic crc ( mcrc ) This activity is not affected by the mutational status of the downstream molecule k - ras. If it were possible to enhance the activity of nk cells, the efficacy of treatment could be increased. The anti - vegf - a mab, bevacizumab, is also active in mcrc regardless of the k- ras mutation status. k cell signaling downstream of fcr . an early clinical study exploring this effect of lenalidomide in k - ras mutant tumors has been initiated. as explained previously , many studies demonstrated the impairment of nk cell activity in cancer patients. In these cases, cytokines could restore and potentiate nkcell - mediated adcc. The antitumor effect and mechanism of action of cetuximab using egfr high - expressing and egfr low - expressing gastric cancer cell lines without gene amplification was investigated. Herceptin - mediated adcc was significantly impaired in pbmc from advanced disease patients compared with that in early disease or healthy individuals. The nk - cell dysfunction on herceptin-mediated adcc correlated with the downregulation of cd16 expression in the patients. This section contains extensive considerations on clinical and laboratory experience in immunologic targeting of malignant cell populations. The use of lymphocytes and/or nk cells as a strategic weapon in preventing or curing the neoplastic relapse after surgery / chemotherapy has been applied to the treatment of hematological malignancies and solid tumors. Transfer of tumor - infiltrating lymphocytes has shown remarkable responses in patients with advanced mm. Nk cells have been implicated in the suppression of graft versus host disease ( gvhd ) , the promotion of bone marrow engraftment , and mediation of a graft versus leukemia ( gvl ) effect. It has been estimated that nk cell alloreactivity can be expected to occur in about 50% of unrelated donor transplants. Alloreactive nk cells, unrestrained by inhibitory signals from the recipient hla ligands, protects against disease relapse. genotype analysis of six major hla loci identified 4 hla - c and 6 hladpb1 mismatch combinations responsible for a decreased risk of relapse and severe acute gvhd. donor selection made in consideration of these results might allow the separation of gvl from acute gVhd. These findings might be crucial to elucidating the mechanism of the decreased risk. of relapse on the basis of hla molecule haplotype. Safety of ex vivo - expanded nk and nk - like t cells with a feeder - free cgmp compatible expansion strategy administered to humans also in combination with il-2. nk cells are also potential tools for cancer therapy , both due to cytotoxic ability enhanced by antibodies and the possibility of ex-vivo expansion and adoptive transfer.

       " 'type 2 diabetes ( t2d) is a complex disease that is reaching epidemic proportions in the developed world. In healthy -cells iapp and insulin share the same secretory pathway in the -cells and thus have ample opportunity to interact. The mechanism of hiapp induced -cell toxicity is not fully understood but a range of mechanisms have been proposed and are likely to be involved in vivo.  insulin is one of the most potent inhibitors of hiapp fibrillization in vitro. Little is known about the mechanism of this crucial inhibition process. The two peptides are identical at 31 of the 37 amino acid locations with the 6 differences occurring in the 1829 region. Riapp does not form amyloid, but does populate a helix  coil monomer isoform that is similar to the conformer formed by the human peptide. The cross section of the hiapp dimer is 10% larger than the rat dimer and simulations argue that it is composed predominantly of coupled -hairpins with a -strand interface. In this conformation insulin is composed of a b chain ( ibc ) and a smaller a - chain ( iac ) connected by two disulfide bonds. iapp at  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 ph 7.4 obtained at 0 ( b ) , 3 ( c ) and 6 h ( d ) after sample preparation. visible aggregates appeared in the sample solution after 6 h. when insulin is added forming  a 1:1 hiapp to insulin ratio at ph \\xa07.4, very different results are obtained. No hIApp aggregates  are detected ( figure 2 ) . the peaks marked by  (  ) are from hiapps and those by ( ) are from insulin \\xa0referring to a spectrum of pure insulin. . This behavior contrasts with hiapp , which rapidly aggregates at high ph , but only slowly at low ph. The extra - celluar environments of  the islets of langerhans ( the regions of the pancreas that contain  the cells which produce insulin and hIApp ) are at ph = 7.4 , but the ph of secretory granule is ph 5.5 . hence it is of interest to further examine the behavior of the mixture at \\xa0ph\\xa05.5. Fluorescence assays have shown that the insulin b - chain inhibits fibril formation of hiapp. But the insulin a - chain does not. We conclude that ibc and full - length insulin interact with hiapps in a similar fashion. Their monomers form heterogeneous clusters with one hiaopp monomer. Gazit and co - workers showed that peptide fragments from a. helical region of ibc interact with peptide. fragments from the region of hiapp that can form a transient helical structure. helix interaction may be involved in the ibc-hiapp interactions that lead eventually to fibril inhibition. We address this point in detail using all atom modeling studies which are described in the next section. The atd of [ nhiapp ] shows a monomer, dimer and smaller trimer and tetramer features. At the higher injection voltage : the large oligomers dissociate leaving monomer and dimer as dominant species in all cases. The question arises as to how ibc and insulin inhibit the hiapp assembly process. Both peptides form heterodimers with hIApp that are in dynamic equilibrium with the monomers. The atds of the + 4 hiapp + 4 monomer all show these same two peaks. The cross sections are identical for all these samples. This suggests the presence of at least two sets of structures, one compact and one more extended. The relative abundance of the -hairpin feature is much smaller in the mixtures of  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 insulin and ibc than it is in the sample of pure hiaopp. An early study has shown that isolated ibc adopts a helix - rich conformation in mixed aqueous organic solution, similar to its structure in intact insulin. The model helix helix complex has a cross section 9% above the experimental cross section of 893  9  , while the model hairpin helix is 22% above that value.  insulin stabilizes hiapp in a monomeric nonamyloidogenic state in solution at low molar ratios ( 1:1 ) for long periods of time. The binding to the helix - rich  conformer is much stronger than to the hairpin - rich hIApp conformer. As long as insulin monomer is stable in solution, monomersic hiaPP are stable. pp is also stabilized through the formation of heterogeneous clusters of insulin and hiapp. A single hiaopp monomer binds up to three insulin monomers, but no\\xa0heterogeneous clusters are observed with more than one. This indicates that the b - chain of insulin plays the primary role in stabilizing soluble hipp. Hiapp samples were synthesized according to procedures previously described. peptide fragments were derived from the shlvealylvcg segment of ibc. The bovine insulin ( catalog no. i5500) was purchased from sigma - aldrich and used without further purification. An asylum research mFP-3d - sa atomic force microscope was used. The amber 8 simulation package was used in modeling the complexes formed by insulin and ibc. ion mobility measurements were recorded using a custom built instrument with a nanoelectrospray ionization ( esi ) source.',\n",
       " 'There are two types of spina bifida. The commonest type is spina\\xa0bifida occulta ( sbo) This is a defect in the vertebral arch of l5 or s1 and results in failure of posterior arch to fuse in the midline. The more severe form of sbo, spina \\xa0vera cystica, involves complete failure of fusion of the posterior arch at the lombosacral region with a large outpouching of the meninges. This may contain cerebrospinal fluid ( meningocele) or a portion of spinal cord ( myelomeningocele) Both conditions are more common in infancy and may resolve with increasing age and both may be related to the voiding dysfunction. We investigated 359 children after the first attack of febrile urinary tract infection that had been referred to radiology department for obtaining voiding cystourethrography ( vcug) The prevalence of vur between children without sbo and children with sbo was not significant. The spina bifida vera cystica is well known and has undisputed neurologic sequelae. Most individuals with sbo are asymptomatic and lack neurologic signs and the condition is considered of no clinical significance. However, sbo is linked with a variety of functional disorders of lower urinary tract in children. ina bifida were less responsive to treatment compared to patients with sacral sbo.

Neither the prevalence of specific symptoms nor how they are related to one another is well understood. Understanding how symptoms cooccur and how the wellbeing of the patient is affected by symptoms is important. Data came from the us national health and wellness survey ( nhws) This is an annual cross - sectional study of more than 70,000 adults aged 18 years or older. The survey was administered via the internet and all measures were by self - report. diagnoses were used to calculate the charlson comorbidity index. The work productivity and activity impairment - general health ( wpai - gh ) questionnaire was used to measure the impact of health on activities. Four metrics of impairment over the previous seven days were calculated : absenteeism, presenteeism, overall work impairment, activity impairment. To assess the relationship between the presence of symptoms and perceived severity of ms , the frequency of each symptom was compared. The sample was primarily female, white , and educated , with a mean age of 49.3 years. almost half characterized their ms as mild , and most rated their ms  as moderate. over two - thirds were overweight / obese ( 67.1% ) and 23% were current smokers. Average length of diagnosis was 12.3 months. A decision was made to include cognitive symptoms ( difficulty concentrating and difficulty remembering ) as their own cluster. The arrangement of the symptoms in the dendrogram after separation of these variables also resulted in urinary incontinence being considered as a cluster of one symptom. This resulted in a set of seven symptoms / symptom clusters for inclusion in the regression models of outcomes.  cluster 2 ( pain, stiffness , and spasms ; 13.6% , p < 0.001 ) , cluster 5 ( depression ; 7.4% ) , and other symptoms ( cluster 7 ;7.4%) were associated with the pain cluster. There was a trend for cluster 7 ( symptoms not included in other clusters ) to have higher odds of moderate or severe ms severity ( or = 1.7 )  pain was by far the most closely related to physical functioning , while depression was the most associated with mental and emotional well - being. the cluster that includes difficulty walking was a significant predictor of physical well -Being and health utility scores but did not itself account for a clinically meaningful decrement in hrqol. the clusters included here are tied to specific aspects of health related quality of life.  symptoms in rrms are strongly related to patient - reported outcomes of hrqol and work productivity. the symptoms seem to cooccur in clusters , and future studies should attempt to confirm whether symptoms cluster in similar ways among other samples of patients. pain, stiffness , and muscle spasms considered as a group seem to interfere with the ability of the individual to do the physical things they want and need to do. depression is predictably associated with poorer mental health.',\n",

Results clearly indicate the potentiality of a. tuberculatus , to search for new and potent proteinase inhibitors. gpi bands were visualized as described in section 2 . figures 2(a) , 2(b) , and 2(c) represent the electrophoretic profile of hGPis in seed extracts of okra and its wild relatives. a. tuberculatus group showed presence of high activity hgpis bands as compared to okra.  bioassay results of pis showed significant reduction in weight of h. armigera larvae when fed on pis obtained from a. tuberculatus 90396 and 90515. larval mortality was observed at 11 days after ingestion which on up to 40% in a. tuberculosisculatus ( 90396 ) and 30% in the wild relative. The second factor that is , age also showed significant differences indicating that the weight of the insect was directly proportional to the age of the insects. The larvae fed on proteinase inhibitor obtained from a. tubercualtus ( 90396 ) and a.\\xa0 tuberculatus ( 90515 ) forms blackish malformed pupae. pupal mortality was only 10% ( figures 3(d) and 3(e) ) . total gut proteinase activity in gut of h. armigera was found to be 2.15  u / gut. tryptic activity was slightly higher ( 1.97  u/ gut ) than the chymotryptic activity. Ten isoforms of gut proteinases were observed , ranging from molecular weight 118.0  kda to 16.2  kDA. The tis and cis isoforms of wild relatives of okra showed significant variation with different intensity , whereas okra genotypes was exhibited monomorphic profile. A similar observation was also reported in pigeon pea by chougule et al . , and they showed that pigeonpea cultivars exhibited monomorphism in tis isoforms and diverse proteinase inhibitory profiles in wild relatives. Okra wild pis offers good gene pool for the development of h. armigera ( bhendi fruit borer ) resistant okra varieties. It offers good source to isolate pis genes for developing insect resistance transgenic plants against h.armigera. The disruption of amino acid by the inhibition of protein digestion through pis is the basis of pis based defense in plants. Pis from a. tuberculatus ( 90396 and 90515 ) were found to possess potential. in the future for developing pis - based management strategies of lepidopteron pest in general and h. armigera in particular. In vitro screening of pis from several cultivated and wild relatives of okra in the present study showed its high specificity towards hgps.',\n",
       " \"Liver cancer ranks fourth in cancer - related mortality around the world. liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in taiwan. There are three common types of cell death : apoptosis , autophagy , and necrosis. There is no study on the determination of major mechanism of antcin k - induced cell death in liver cancer cells. P perk , ire1 , and atf-6 are all involved in the induction of proapoptotic as well as prosurvival pathways. calcium is a common metal ion , which plays a dominant role in cell death signaling transduction. We will demonstrate how antcin k modulates cell death through the change of calcium distribution in human liver cancer cells. The antcin k. fraction with 100% ea / hexane contained the highest amount of antcin. It was further purified by high - performance liquid chromatography to obtain antcink with > 90% purity. Antibodies were purchased from invitrogen ( carlsbad , ca , usa ) and genetex ( irvine , ca ) The human hepatoma hep 3b cell line was a kind gift from professor ming - shi shiao ( medical research and education department , taipei veterans general hospital ) Hepat 3b cells were cultured in dulbecco 's modified eagle 's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1.5  g / l sodium bicarbonate , 1% nonessential amino acids , and 1% antibiotic antcin k. liver cancer cells at a concentration of 5    10 cells / well were seeded in 96-well plates and incubated for 24 hours. The cells (5    10 cells / well ) were seeded in 96-well plates for 24 hours. after 24 hours of treatment, 90  l lysis solution was added to each well and incubated for 10 minutes. the slides were mounted and examined under a leica tcs sp5 ii confocal fluorescence microscope ( leica , solms , germany ) for the mitochondria calcium staining. Cells were stained by 4m fluo-3-acetoxymethyl ester, 5m dihydrodichlorofluorescein diacetate, and 4m 3,3-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide at 37c for 30 minutes. For the detection of autophagosome , the cells were permeabilized with 0.25  mg / ml digitonin for 5 minutes. cells were washed and filtered prior to being analyzed by a becton - dickinson facscan flow cytometer. Hep 3b cells were treated with 0m , 80m , 100m , and 125m antcin k for 24 hours or 48 hours. Cell lysates were sonicated and cleared by centrifugation. The relative density of each band after normalization for -actin was analyzed using image j 1.45 software. Cell viability was analyzed by mtt assay. After 48 hours of treatment, cell survival rates decreased to 76.7    2.1% , 65.0   8.6% , and 46.2% , respectively. immunofluorescence at 24 hours showed that 80m , 100m , and 125m antcin k treatment resulted in the formation of chromatin condensation in hep 3b cells. the nuclei of control cells were round and dim , whereas those became condensed and bright after antcinK treatment. higher concentrations of antcink led to a longer dna migration smear ( comet tail) Hep 3b cells were treated with 0m , 80m , 100m , and 125m antcin k for 48 hours. mitochondrial membrane potential was analyzed and quantified by flow cytometry. mitochondrial free calcium levels were quantitated in cells still viable with the cell - permeability acetoxymethyl ester of the fluorescent marker rhod-2. Antcin k is a triterpenoid from fruiting bodies of basswood cultivated a.  cinnamomea. Treatment of hep 3b cells with antcin k caused the cells to undergo apoptotic cell death through the mitochondrial and er stress signaling pathway.  antcin k can increase ros generation in human hepatoma hep 3b cells and also reduce the atp level of the cells. This suggests that er may be damaged by oxidation and in a hypoxic state. When er stress was induced, the protein expression of chop increased and downregulated bcl - xl. This promoted intracellular calcium ion release from the er then transfer into the mitochondria. Eburicoic acid and antcin k could not induce autophagy in hep 3b cells. The cell death mechanism of triterpenoids from a.  cinnamomea was not the same. This study is the first of its kind to show that antcink has an antiproliferative effect.  antcin k treatment induced hep 3b cell death via promotion of intracellular ros generation and atp depletion , leading to er stress. It also induced caspase - dependent apoptosis by activating caspases-9 and casp enzyme-3. It induced protein expressions of aif , endo g , and htra2.\",\n",
       " \"Due to the increasing number of multilinguals in modern society, the incidence of language impairments induced by brain lesions ( aphasia) in this population is growing rapidly. The recovery patterns for each language in multilingual aphasic patients vary considerably and so far are unpredictable. Language recovery in bilingual aphasics depends on the degree of language mastery. There is only sparse evidence for any association between control function and language recovery since control functions are rarely specifically assessed in aphasic patients. verreyt et al. reported the case of an early french - dutch bilingual aphasics who presented larger impairment in dutch. They found that the engagement of the areas mediating language control played a crucial role in language recovery. The network underlying language control is described by abutalebi and green. It includes the prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex and the basal ganglia. The prefrontal cortex is involved in word production in the less proficient language and in inhibiting responses from the more proficient language. It is worth noting that understanding neural mechanisms underlying patterns of recovery has many implications for the therapeutic approach. Bilingual patients suffered from aphasia following a focal left - hemispheric brain lesion. The patients were evaluated at two time points ( subacute and chronic phases , three months apart ) Three main analyses were conducted to examine the pattern of changes in patients ' language and control functions. We examined the correlations between the recovery of language functions and the changes in the strength of connections between the above - mentioned areas using group analyses. We chose to evaluate bilingual aphasic patients during the subacute phase since this population has rarely been studied in the acute and subACute phases. This will allow us to better understand the contribution of the control system. The study procedure was approved by the local ethics committees of geneva university hospital ( ce 12 - 274 ) and fribourg cantonal hospital ( 018/12-cer - fr ) . yl is a 61 -year - old man who is a french ( l1)-english ( l2 ) bilingual. ca is a 63 -year-old woman who is an italian ( l 1)-french ( l 2 ) bilingual\\xa0. figure specifically designed for each of them ( figures 3(a)7(a ) ) Before the stroke, the main language of conversation was french with her husband and children and at work ( 75% ) and she spoke italian with her parents ( 100% ) . she was admitted to hug because of right hemiparesis and severe global aphasia due to a left basal ganglia hemorrhagic stroke with no evidence of midline shift. within a few days, globalAphasia developed into severe anomia with hypophonia mainly affecting l2. Patients were assessed at subacute ( three to five weeks after stroke onset , t1 ) and chronic ( three months after t1 evaluation , t2 ) phases. The patients performed a language production task ( picture naming ) in each language. The global severity of the aphasia and language capacities was assessed using a separate evaluation of language capacities in eachlanguage. A linguistic switching task ( adapted from abutalebi et al . 2008 for aphasic patients ): forty images ( black and white line drawing picture ) of snodgrass and vanderwart   ( all noncognate words ) were used for each list. This task lasted between 10 and 12 minutes depending on patients ' response time. A nonlinguistic switching task : four images ( a red or blue circle or square ) were presented on the upper or the lower part of the screen. Eight pairs of lists were prepared ( a combination of french as first or second language and the other four languages) Subjects were asked to name the images in l1 when the image appeared on the upper part of the screen and name the image in l2 when it was presented on the lower part. Each trial was started manually by the experimenter when the word  ready ?  was present on the screen. Each fmri session started with a picture naming in l1 ; in this part , the subjects were instructed to name the pictures that appeared on the screen in their l1. The first six trials of the task were cued with the language in which the image should be named ( l1 or l2 ) written on the left of the image. After about 30 seconds of rest, the subjects started their second task in which they had to names the pictures in their second language. The subjects had at most between 9,100 and 11,100  ms to respond to the images. Three scanners were used for the experiment. Subjects were in a supine position with their heads stabilized by foam to reduce head movements. They wore headphones ( mkii system from mr confon , magdeburg , germany ) coupled with an mri - compatible microphone to record oral response. The stimuli resolution was 1024  768 with a refresh rate of 60  hz. A b0 field inhomogeneity mapping sequence was acquired to correct for geometrical distortion that occurred along the phase - encoding direction. Each fmri acquisition session started with six seconds of dummy scans to ensure a steady - state magnetization of the tissues. We used the spm8 software ( welcome trust centre for neuroimaging , institute of neurology , university college london ) , running on matlab 2012b.  mask file of the brain lesion of each subject was manually drawn on axial slices of the standard montreal neurological institute 's ( mni ) brain template. time series from all voxels were submitted to a high - pass filter with a 1/250  hz threshold. autoregressive function ( ar ( 1 ) ) was applied. The same model was used for all subjects ( patients and controls ) and for both testing sessions. We included only left - hemispheric regions as our main focus was the effect of control areas on the intrahemispheric reorganization of language areas. When the patients or control subjects did not fulfill our criteria ( showing activation with threshold < 0.05 uncorrected in all 5 rois and/or absence of lesion in the rois ) they were removed from the analyses. We compared the three models ( two models with modulatory effect of picture naming on lifgtri or btla and a model with no modulatory Effect ) using a bayesian model selection with a fixed effect strategy. The model with modulation effect Using dcm on fmri, we compared the strength of connectivity within the language - control network between l1 and l2 across time at single subject level. At the group level, we then performed a correlation analysis between the recovery of language production scores and the changes in connection strength between language and control areas. No improvement was found in linguistic and nonlinguistic switching tasks accuracy. At t2 ( chronic phase), the combined production score improved in both l1 (  : 9.09 , p : 0.002 ) and l2 ( : 5.14 , p: 0.023 ) However, no significant improvement was found in linguistic and nonlinguistic switching tasks ( figure 4(c) ) ( see table 3 for details of the patient 's performance) The patient also showed a significant improvement in both linguistic and nonlinguistic switching tasks across time. The raw differences in the strength of connections within the language - control network in this patient also indicated differing patterns in the connection strengths between l1 and l2. At t1 ( subacute phase ) , around half of connections had higher strength values for l1 ( eight out of nine) than for l2 at t2 ( chronic phase) The combined production score improved in both l1 (  : 9.09 , p : 0.002 ) and l2 ( : 12.07 , p: 0.0005 ) at t2 ( chronic phase ) , although the patient still made several language switching errors. However, no improvement was seen in the linguistic and nonlinguistic switching task performances. Using a longitudinal design , we examined language production recovery in five late bilingual patients suffering from poststroke aphasia at subacute and chronic phases following a stroke. Three of our five patients recovered in both l1 and l2 ( patients 2, 3, and 5 ) , one patient recovered in l1 ( patient 1 ) , and one ( patient 4 ) in l2 only. Two patients ( patient 3 with recovery in both languages and patient 4 with recovery of l2 ) showed improvement in language - control functions ( table 4) The majority of connections within language - control network ( 10 out of 15 connections ) had higher connection strength values at the chronic phase. improvement in production score in one language was associated with an increase in the number of connections with higher strength values while performing the task in that specific language. The observed pattern of language and control recovery does not directly support paradis ' statement that when language- control function is intact one can expect a parallel recovery of languages. Our results support a role for language - control interconnections in language recovery in bilingual aphasic patients. For patients in whom both languages recovered ( patients 2, 3, and 5 ) , the two languages were connected to the control system to the same extent. When one language recovered better , there was a greater engagement of language- control interConnections in this language. The coupling between these two areas became stronger when l1 recovered. In patients with l2 recovery ( four out of five patients ) , the connection from lifgtri to lifgorb becomes weaker for l2 compared to l1. The reason could be explained by the revised hierarchical model of lexical and conceptual representation in the bilingual brain. Only three patients followed language therapy sessions and the therapy was computer assisted to improve lexical access and in turn improve naming performances. No consistent pattern of the effect of therapy and possible cross language transfer was found. As the design is mainly within - subject the age does not seem to affect importantly the results. The engagement of the interconnected language - control network is crucial for the recovery of languages. We suggest that l1 recovery is improved by increased connectivity between acc and lifgtri , which prevents conflicts from the second language. However, l2 recovery requires a decrease in connectivity fromlifgtri to lifgorb in order to decrease the automatic activation of the l1 lexical system.\",\n",
       " 'Surgical glove offers protection against infection transmission between perioperative staffs and the patient. using double gloves and indicator gloves and changing gloves at regular intervals and before specific procedure during surgery are some of the methods that can be used to reduce risks. latex gloves offer protection but are often punctured , rendering them ineffective. Surgical gloves were invented by the german surgeon von mikulicz. Initially surgical gloves were used to protect the surgical team from getting infected. The advent of parenterally transmissible diseases such as hiv and hepatitis b and the risks of their transmission during surgeries has resulted in reappraisal of surgical techniques and instruments. Study was of single gloving system as it was the common practice in this hospital. 191 gloves collected from 19 primary hip replacement arthroplasties with 15 being total hip replacementArthroplasty and four hemiarthroplasty. glove perforation was detected in 23 gloves ( 12.04% )  glove perforations in index finger, thumb, and palm area accounted for 69.6% of total perforation during surgery. during surgery six gloveperforations were detected ( 26.1% ) . there was no significant difference between glove per forforation in dominant hand and nondominant hand ( with p < 0.05 being significant )  glove perforation occurs most commonly in the thumb and index finger of the nondominant hand. Majority of the perforations were found in gloves worn by the surgeon and the first assistant. prolonged operation duration in conjunction with a perforated glove increases the contamination risk. Arthroplasty is not an uncommon phenomenon. In this study of single gloving system glove perforation rate was 12.04% whereas literature reports of glove perfusion rate as low as 3.3% in elective orthopedic surgeries. as such emphasis should be given to wear double pair of gloves.',\n",
       " \"The use of public resources to combat lifestyle - related disease sometimes comes under criticism. interventions intended to assist the overweight or smokers are often debated in the press. One argument levelled at such interventions is that they reward ( explicitly or otherwise ) bad behaviour. Personal responsibility has been increasingly incorporated into welfare state policies, particularly since the 1970s. In 2009 one quarter of adults in england were estimated to be obese ( with a body mass index of 30 or more) 21% of the adult population of great britain were smokers ( a figure unchanged since 2007). The national audit office estimates that obesity costs the national health service ( nhs ) more than half a billion pounds a year. i am explicitly excluding  forward - looking or  as - if responsibility where ascriptions are based on the positive consequences that might derive from holding agents responsible. responsibility may discourage risky behaviour and help to avoid  moral hazard. if responsibility may also be used to develop the capacity for responsibility in children ( if they are told they will be held responsible they may learn to take on the role of a responsible agent )  differences that stem from inequalities in power , money and resources contribute to the unequal distribution of health outcomes. These include the social environment, psychosocial factors, behaviours and biological factors. In turn, these factors are influenced by social position, itself shaped by education, occupation, income, gender and race. Poverty and deprivation early in life can hinder the development of self - regulatory capacities needed to alter habitual behaviours. Smokers from the most deprived socioeconomic groups are as likely to attempt to quit smoking ( and to seek help in doing so) as those from the highest socioeconomic groups. To meet the requirement for ownership of action , the agent may need to act in line with how she perceives herself , and not counter to her long - term desires and goals. Where an agent 's behaviour is controlled by overwhelming desires , perhaps through addiction or compulsion , it may not count as her action. The final requirement for free action relates to social status. i have argued that the social gradient in health can be considered as linked to freedom. those who are subject to more social deprivation are more likely to have their freedom limited across the three components of freedom that pettit describes. as freedom is equated with fitness to be held responsible , this has relevance for policies which assume agents are morally responsible for their ( un)healthy behaviour. The social patterning of some sorts of disease does suggest that the mechanisms causing disease involve less personal control than one might assume. thus , where we are concerned with lifestyle - related diseases , such as ncds , freedom , ( and by implication , responsibility ) might be undermined. i do not show that all those engaging in unhealthy behaviour are not morally responsible for their actions.\",\n",
       " 'Pharmacists are gradually shifting their attention from the passive dispensing of medications to actively caring for their patients. A key role of pharmacists in ensuring the safety of medications prescribed and dispensed to patients emerged. The impact of the ideals of pharmaceutical care on the change of pharmacy and on its new ethical paradigm can not be underestimated. The literature on prescribing errors is gaining momentum. The data so far suggests that the problem is not limited to any specific health care environment or defined practice setting. Technology has a promising role in reducing adverse drug events. There is still a paucity of research reporting the role of pharmacists in identifying these errors. The aim of this study was to characterize and analyze interventions documented by pharmacists in outpatient pharmacies of a primary health care service in qatar. pharmacists used online integrated health care software ( trakcare ; intersystems , cambridge , ma , usa ) to document all interventions made. Each intervention made was communicated to the respective prescriber by the intervening pharmacist in person or by phone. intervention data and their outcomes were retrieved weekly from the respective clinics software and entered into a dedicated excel spreadsheet. The study was approved by the department of medical services at the primary health care facility in doha. The data were exported from the clinics integrated health care software into the study excel spreadsheet and then to the spss software for analysis. The study looked at interventions made without reference to the identities of specific patient , doctor , or pharmacist. There were 594 patients whose prescriptions were intercepted for suspected errors ( 0.72% ) The percentage of errors intercepted ranged from 0.4 to 1.9 % of the total prescriptions dispensed. over half of all errors were related to drug choice problems, followed by drug safety problems. In 35% of the interventions, a dose was changed , and in 20% the drug was changed. 1.7% prescriptions with an error is more than double that reported in the uk,13 but it is significantly smaller than figures reported elsewhere ( sayer and colleagues,18 and leemans and colleagues19 ) who reported 12.4% and 4.1% prescribing errors , respectively. We believe that pharmacists might achieve better acceptance of drug interventions by clinicians if they reference these interventions to previous , joint professional development sessions and published literature.  interventions that were more likely to be accepted by the prescribing physicians were those involving dosage errors, duplicate therapy , and drug choice problems. dispensing a prescription that could have an error raises significant ethical issues relating to the pharmacist s hippocratical obligation towards beneficence and nonmalfeasance. No retrospective validation process was carried out by an independent reviewer on the interventions made or those rejected in this study. The study did not attempt to classify the interventions beyond the pcne classification system into broad drp types. documenting and analyzing interventions should be a routine activity in pharmacy practice of primary health care services. progressive pharmacists are recognizing that this is only the first step in the process of improving patient safety.',\n",
       " 'The protocols for flim sample preparation do not differ from those for confocal or wide - field intensity - based fluorescence microscopy. The data acquisition is followed by the main task of data analysis , i.e. extracting the fluorescence lifetimes from the raw data. The cells are grown on in a multiwell plate with a coverslide underside for microscopy , in an incubator at 37 c with a 5 % co2 atmosphere until 80% confluent. Fluorescence lifetime histogram plots how often certain fluorescence lifetimes occur versus the fluorescence lifetime itself. each pixel is colored with the result of the fit , and a flim map is obtained. If a monoexponential fit does not yield a chi - squared value of around 1 ( and up to 1.3 ) indicates a good fit. Fluorescence decays measured for the fluorescent molecular rotor at increasing viscosity in methanol / glycerol mixtures are shown in fig. 1 ( and up to 1.3 ) , and there is a systematic deviation of the residuals from zero , a more sophisticated model is required. The results for the fluorescence lifetimes , pre - exponential factors and the lifetime ratio for each pixel can then be encoded in color. Fluorescence decays in every pixel of the image can be adequately fitted using a single exponential decay model. This shorter liftime corresponds to a lower viscosity in the puncta , probably lipid droplets according to the frster - hoffmann equation. By plotting the lifetimes extracted from every pixel we obtain a fluorescence lifetime histogram of the whole image. Image a non - stained sample and verify that it does not fluoresce. switch to flim mode - this is easily accomplished by moving a mirror out of the fluorescence detection beam path. An appropriate fluorescence emission filter to block any exciting light from reaching scan the sample and check that the detector count rate is no more than about 1%. Fluorescence lifetime histograms should accompany all images for easy visualisation of average fluorescence lifetime values. fluorescence decays measured for the fluorescent molecular rotor at increasing viscosity in methanol / glycerol mixtures are shown in fig. 3. The results for the fluorescence lifetimes , pre - exponential factors , and the lifetime ratio for each pixel can then be encoded in color. Fluorescence decays in every pixel of the image can be adequately fitted using a single exponential decay model. instrumental artifacts include scattered light which will show up as a peak on top of the beginning of the fluorescence decay. filter or glass fluorescence could also cause an artifact , especially at low sample fluorescence. A constant background should be obtained in each pixel of the image. regions where deviations from a constant background occur will never yield a good fit and should be avoided for the measurement if they can not be eliminated by adjusting the parameters for the tcspc card. photon pile - up is caused by too high a photon detection rate.',\n",
       " 'nearly all of the photoactive iridium(iii) complexes that are used as emitters in electroluminescent devices, as dyes in solar cells, in nonlinear optics ( nlo ) and in bioimaging contain conjugated  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 five - membered chelated ligands. photoactive   iridium complexes containing a six- membered cyclometalating chelate are very rare. The few reported examples can be categorized into two families of complexes. We investigated the coordination of 2-benzhydrylpyridine ( bnpyh2 ) derivatives with ir(iii ) in order to access six - membered  chelate complexes t1t3 ( figure 1a ) The formation of 1 arises from a highly unusual double c  h bond activation of the bn pyh2 ligand. The ligand binds to the iridium in a tripodal fashion. It is a very poorly luminescent near - ir emitter in ch2cl2. ocyclometalating planar tridentate  bis(five - membered ) chelate ligands have been more widely explored. kozhevnikov has reported dinuclear ir(iii) complexes with a bridging ligand featuring two n^c^n motifs. compounds l1 , l2 , and l3 ( scheme 1) were synthesized in two steps via a grignard  reaction followed by a reduction step and obtained as solids in good yields. complexes 13 were characterized by h , c , and , for 3 , f nmr spectroscopy; esi - hr mass spectra; elemental analysis. The structures of 13 complexes were determined by single - crystal x - ray diffraction. All three complexes possess a distorted octahedral geometry with the tridentate tripod ligand coordinated to the iridium to form two six - membered chelated rings. Both cyclometalating carbon atoms are trans to the pyridine rings of the dtbubpy. The pyridyl unit of the bnpy - type ligands istrans to the chloride . The electrochemistry data can be found in table 1 , and the voltammograms are shown in figure 2. The cvs of 13 show irreversible reduction waves that are monoelectronic as inferred from the respective dpvs. The lumo is almost exclusively  localized on the dtbubpy ligand , while the lumo+1 is primarily on the pyridyl ring of the bnpy - type ligand. All three complexes are significantly more difficult to reduce than [ ir(mesppy)2(dtbubpy)]pf6. reduction wave of 3 at 1.62 v is anodically shifted by 200 mv compared to 1 and 2. measurements were carried out in degassed ch2cl2 at a scan rate of 50 mv s with fc / fc used as the internal reference.  weak bands (  on the order of 10 m cm ) with onsets between 470 and 510 nm are attributed to a mixture of mlct / llct and spin - forbidden mlct or llct transitions. introduction of the tert - butyl groups in 2 results in a small red - shift of the ct bands below 340 nm. The photoluminescence quantum yield ( pl ) of 1 is 8% , which is lower than that of the  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 yellow - emitting [ ir(ppy)2(dtbubpy)]pf6.  complex 3 possesses both the largest kr ( 3.62  10 s ) and the smallest knr values ( 10.31  10s ) in accordance with the  energy gap law.

Evidence of metastatic disease at diagnosis is the most clinically relevant prognostic factor affecting 25% of patients. Patients with metastatic or recurrent es continue to have a dismal prognosis with less than 20% overall survival.  metastatic clones may undergo genetic changes that allow them to react differently to chemotherapeutic agents as well as signals in the microenvironment ( of lung or bone ) leading to a more aggressive , resistant phenotype. Many questions remain regarding the presence of es clones that may lead to occult metastatic deposits and subsequently to recurrence of disease. Patients with primary pulmonary metastasis fare better than their counterparts with bone or bone marrow disease. Despite systemic chemotherapy and good local control modalities , even patients with clinically localized es have a high - risk of relapse at distant sites. micrometastasis is almost universally present but undetected at initial diagnosis. Ewing sarcoma relapse usually presents within 5  years following intensive multi - agent chemotherapy and aggressive local control measures. The predominant type of relapse in patients with initial metastatic disease is systemic ( defined as distant recurrence only ) with 73% of patients presenting almost evenly with pulmonary , bone , or multisystem recurrent sites.  es cells have a propensity to metastasize to the lung, bone , and bone marrow. The bone is a rich repository of growth factors including stem cell factor ( scf) scf expressed in potential metastatic sites may serve a chemoattractant role. An understanding of these unique tumor microenvironment and host  tumor interactions may offer new therapeutic targets. Fibroblast growth factor produced by bmscs may promote a metastatic phenotype in es tumors by increasing cell motility. Small molecule inhibitors against these catalytic receptors may provide a therapeutic option in es. targeting lyn using a small interfering rna ( sirna ) or the small molecule inhibitor ap23994 resulted in suppression of tumor growth. Ezrin may also have a role in development and growth of metastasis in es. manipulation of the ezrin pathway may be explored in the future as a means to decrease the development of metastatic disease. as cancer genomes become more unstable, the number of copy number aberrations ( cna) increases. 6387% of es tumor samples have cnas detected by cgh. The most common of these cnas have been analyzed for possible prognostic capacity. Many groups found no statistically significant changes in event - free survival or overall survival in es based on cnas. Two different groups found that the number of aberrations did significantly predict patient survival. There is not a particular aberration or combination of changes being used to stratify patients for therapy. Fli1 expression was shown to be sufficient to reverse transformation and tumorigenic properties. Fli1 expression is likely not the only genetic or epigenetic hit that is required for development and maintenance of es. Hopefully, as the resolution of snp microarrays increases and next - generation sequencing is introduced , more clinically relevant and cooperating cnas may be discovered in es.  resistant es clones compete to survive by evading chemotherapy and responding to signal from metastatic sites. enhanced genomic instability may favor their adaptation. while understanding the biology of the primary tumor is of utmost importance , it is also critical to understand genetic and epigenetic changes that are associated with the metastatic state.',\n",

A nuclear medicine physician and a radiologist with musculoskeletal expertise reviewed all pet / ct images together with the primary objective of identifying or ruling out the presence of lesions amenable to surgical intervention. The most important feature for identifying an abnormality requiring surgery was focal and well - circumscribed activity clearly above the background spine that coregistered on the ct image. Pet / ct foci were considered false positive if no operable abnormality was found on surgery or if symptoms improved without surgical intervention. negative pet / cT scans were considered true negative if Symptoms improved with nonsurgical management and/or were corroborated as stable or resolved on adjunctive imaging examinations such as ct and mri. The intensity of the patient s pain was graded from 0 to 4 prior to initiation of treatment and at the 15-month follow - up. The background suvmax was recorded from the closest comparable vertebral structure without a lesion and ranged from 4.4 to 5.9 ( average 5.2, median 5.4). increased sclerosis is apparent on the ct image at the right l5-s1 graft compared to the left that was initially described as postoperative changes. Of the 16 patients with abnormal pet / ct results, 15 went on to surgical exploration. The orthopedist found abnormalities in 14 of 15 of these patients that correlated precisely with the pet or ct findings and led to repair of the hardware or spine. Of the 22 patients, 6 did not have any foci that appeared amenable to surgery and conservative treatment was recommended. In all six patients, pain had improved without surgery and the imaging results were scored as true negative. 15 of 16 patients who underwent surgical exploration based on pet / ct results were confirmed to have lesions requiring surgical intervention by either histopathology or direct manual probing. The single false - positive result in this study occurred in a patient who underwent scanning just 4  months after spinal fusion. Most of the postoperative spine in all patients showed normal f - naf activity compared to background vertebrae despite extensive hardware placement. The literature on the use of f - naf pet / ct for evaluating the postoperative spine is otherwise very scant. A 1987 study by slizofski et al. prospectively evaluated 15 symptomatic patients following lumbar fusion. The authors concluded that spect imaging is particularly useful for excluding bony causes of recurrent back pain. positive lesions are helpful for identifying causative abnormalities.  f - naf pet / ct imaging demonstrated potential for aiding management of patients with recurrent pain after spinal fusion surgery by helping to correctly identify those requiring surgical intervention. The pilot cohort investigated in our project was small and our high reported sensitivity and specificity should be viewed with caution. The data and image quality appear promising and a larger clinical evaluation is warranted.',\n",
       " ' inadequate pain relief in practice is well documented and can involve up to 40% of patients. nurses have a key role in effective pain management; therefore , nurses knowledge is of critical importance in the care of patients with cancer pain. One of the most important deficiencies of nurses about cancer pain assessment is that their assessment often focuses on patients behaviors rather than pain intensity. The purpose of this study was to identify the level of knowledge , attitude , and hbm constructs among aalzahra hospital nurses regarding the management of cancer pain. The questionnaire contained two sections : ( a) socio - demographic characteristics of nurses ( such as sex , education , marital status ) and ( b) knowledge and h BM constructs. The majority of nurses had insufficient knowledge and attitude regarding cancer pain management.  pearson correlation test showed that the knowledge of the nurses had a direct relationship with their attitude , perceived benefits , self - efficacy , and cues to action . but knowledge had reverse relationship with perceived barriers and perceived threat. On average, the nurses included in this study showed low scores on knowledge and attitudes regarding cancer pain management. 78.5% of nurses agreed with the important role of seminars and workshops to increase their knowledge toward cancer pain management. The study sample was taken from a university hospital so it can not necessarily be generalized to other staff populations. The deficits in knowledge and attitude identified in this survey are a significant barrier to the effective management of pain in cancer patients.',\n",

       " 'A better understanding of how different biological processes are altered by organosulfurs has become important because of the increasing number of reports on disease alteration by xenobiotic and food compounds. The data are quite indisputable that to enhance ivrp processes , 2me and cysteamine absolutely required the presence of either cysteine or cystine. A potential exception to this requirement was reported for 2me supplemented ivc in which development of porcine embryos to the blastocyst stage was enhanced. Mixed disulfides were rapidly taken up by cells and internally converted into 2me and several other compounds. This enhanced uptake was apparently sufficient to overcome the rate limiting constraint of low cysteine levels for gsh synthesis. However, questions of what other biological processes were influenced by the internalized disulfide remain to be determined. 2me and cysteamine act as scavengers of ros. Evidence to support this mechanism for ivrp was derived by comparing changes in ros , apoptotic , and dna damage that occur in the  presence of thiol and non - thiol antioxidants. 2me alone ( but not cysteine  alone even though it increased gsh ) reduced 21% of gsh. The study found that a reduction in ros like an increase in synthesis of gsh can be uncoupled from development. The results are in line with the estimate that only 2545% of 2me s benefits for lymphoid functions in  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 vitro are due to antioxidant activity alone. The mechanisms by which thiols enhance ivrp is almost certainly multifaceted. Development of an embryo to a stage worthy of transfer to a recipient may depend upon a combination of multiple thiol benefits that may act synergistically. The media components found to enhance the overall process of embryo development are essential and nonessential amino acids.',\n",

       " 'lead ( pb) is a heavy metal found extensively distributed in the soil from which a great variety of products are made. The most common lead exposure sources in mexico are the metallurgical industry emissions , battery recycling establishments , soil and the use of glazed pottery for food preparation and storage. chronic lead poisoning can cause a decrease in iq and mental development and attention disorders with blood lead levels below 10 g / dl. The persistence of lead poisoning in children arises out of the fact that some countries recognize and have identified and regulated sources of lead exposure but have not yet implemented monitoring and exposure prevention programs. therefore, this research seeks to identify the presence of lead in glazed ceramic utensils that are sold in a mexican - us border city. The swab was rubbed inside the cooking pot for 30 seconds. If lead was present , the swab color changed from pink to red. The darker the red , the higher the lead content. 73.2% ( 30 out of 41 ) of the pots were lead - positive and 26.8% ( 11 of 41) were lead-negative. Of the 37 glazed pots, 81.1% ( 30 out of 37 ) were lead - positive and 18.9% ( 7 of 37) were lead- negative. Only 4 of the cooking pots had no glaze and they were all ( 100% ) lead - negative. The use of glazed pottery for cooking and food storage has been a significant predictor of elevated blood lead levels in mexican population.  experimental trials have demonstrated that it is not possible to eliminate exposure to lead in glazed ceramic vessels using home methods.

It affects mostly women, especially after menopause as a result of estrogen withdrawal. A thin mandibular cortical width has been shown to be correlated with reduced skeletal bone mineral density. The aims of this study were to evaluate the influence of gender and dental status on the mental index, mandibular cortical index, and panoramic mandi index on dental radiographs in the elderly with osteoporosis and without. Four hundred eighty - seven elderly dental patients ( age - range 6088 years - mean age 67.9 years) were evaluated. The mandibular cortical shape is classified into one of three groups according to the method of klemetti et al:22 c1the endosteal cortical margin is even and sharp on both sides , normal cortex ( figure 1 ) ; c2theendosteal margin has semi - lunar defects ( lacunar resorption ) , mild to moderate cortex erosion ; c3the cortical layer forms heavy endostealing cortical residues and is clearly porous , severely eroded cortex. Mandibular cortical width at the mental region ( mcw ) and panoramic mandibular index ( pmi ) were assessed on the dental pan oramic radiographs by an observer. The mean cortical width was calculated. dentate individuals were classified according to the presence ofmandibular molars. those individuals having mandibational molars were classified as dentate , whereas those without mandibula molars , but with other teeth present , were categorized as partially dentate. three groups were created : 1 ) dentate, 2 ) partially dentates ( missing all mandibul molars ) , and 3 ) edentulous. Table 1 shows the gender and dental status characteristics of the study sample. distribution according to gender and the number of subjects with osteoporosis and without osteop orosis was shown in table 2. There was a significant difference between females and males for mcw and pmi values. dental status was significantly different according to the categories of mci.

Le treatments increased the intracellular calcium levels in h9c2 cells. Long chain fatty acids directly activate calcium channels at some lipid sites near the channels. Lipofundin mct / lct seems to be a more effective le for treating this condition than intralipid. We found that les increased intracellular calcium level more than three times in h9c2 cells. The positive inotropic effect of les may be associated with cardiac myocyte calcium concentration. We did not verify the source of the increase or the channel involved. Lipofundin mct / lct had more of a positive inotropic effect than that of intralipid. Inotropic effect of les may be related to increased intracellular calcium levels in the heart. we assume that this may have affected the limited increase in lvsp after the intralipsid treatment.',\n",

The visuals of the film include classroom shots, laboratory imagery showing scientists at work, archival stills, and allegoric scenes. The film is meant to serve as part i in a series of short films that are forthcoming. The series will present the historical cases mentioned in part i and connect them with present issues and realities. The film dear scientists is an open letter to the scientific community and aims to sensitize its members. The film s aim is to unite people with different viewpoints and perspectives and motivate them to discuss and find solutions. The arts should play a significant role in issues of science ethics. Being predominantly an emotional endeavor, the arts can bring together humanities, science , engineering and medicine in challenging discussions on morality.',\n",

The patient gradually developed difficulty with ambulation to the point that he needed assistance getting up and with transfers. Sagittal t2-weighted image of the thoracic spine demonstrate hyper intense t2 signal abnormality within the central area of the spinal cord extending from t6 to the conus medullaris. Figure 3 shows prominent tortuous intradural veins from level t1112 down to the cauda equina nerve roots.  sdavf is a rare spinal vascular malformation which can lead to significant morbidity when left untreated. The point at which a meningeal artery pierces the dura represents a potential site for the development of a dural arteriovenous fistula. The median time from symptom onset to diagnosis falls in the range of 1244 months. In a retrospective analysis of 156 sdavfs, these patients often present with progressive myelopathy, claudication, sensory loss, bowel and bladder dysfunction. Myelography is recommended by some authors for patients whose clinical findings are consistent with sdavf but have negative or equivocal mri findings. postgadolinium mr angiography can aid in the diagnosis of spinal sdavfs by supplementing the information provided by the mri. endovascular embolization can sometimes lead to incomplete obliteration of the fistula.\",\n",
       " 'cardiac myxomas are the most common benign cardiac tumour usually found in the left atrium. They usually present with at least one of the classical triad of obstructive cardiac, embolic and constitutional symptoms. We describe an unusual presentation of atrial myxoma with microscopic haematuria and significant non - nephrotic - range proteinuria. Atrial myxoma with proteinuria and haematuria in the absence of any other clinical signs or symptoms is very unusual. cardiac myxomas also secrete interleukin-6 ( il-6 ) which may have a role in the development of renal injury and proteinuria. Myxomas cause local activation of the immune system allowing the production of autoantibodies by bystander activation. Myxomas are an important consideration in the differential diagnosis of many renal conditions. cardiac myxomas could imitate connective tissue disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus and vasculitis such as polyarteritis nodosa. the production of aeca and il-6 by cardiac myXomas may be relevant as these substances have been implicated with the development of renal injury and proteinuria.',\n",
       " 'An ongoing issue is whether similar or different mechanisms contribute to the pathogenesis of different ms subtypes. Current opinion implicates peripheral t cells in an autoimmune response directed against cns antigens as the pathogenetic mechanism in rrms. Some claim that cns injury in progressive ms is due to neurodegeneration or a neuroinflammatory process confined within the blood brain barrier. We studied identical twins discordant for rrms. In comparisons with healthy identical twin pairs , both the affected twins and their healthy cotwins had tcr repertoire shifts. The findings suggested that these shifts precede r rms and likely predispose to the development of rRms.  reduced sjtrecs in constant cell numbers could be due to reduced thymic output or to increased peripheral t - cell proliferation. nave t cells contain the vast majority of sjTrecs whereas memory t cell contain very few sj Trecs. In order to exclude possible treatment influences on sj trecs, we only studied rrms patients in remission. None of the patients had been treated with corticosteroids or immunomodulatory agents. Sjtrecs are influenced not only by thymic output but also by t cell division. Younger rrms and ppms patients had lower sjtrec frequencies than controls of a similar age. These frequencies remained at low levels with increasing age of the patients. Thymic export of nave cd4 t - cells / day was lower in ppms than rRms. We found increased expression of bcl-2 by both nave cd4 and cd8 t cells from ppms patients compared to controls. These findings suggest increased delivery of survival signal in both patient groups. Increased bcl -2 expression may also have relevance for ms susceptibility. overexpression of -arrestin 1 increases susceptibility to eae. We concluded calculations of sj/trec ratios would not provide accurate , direct measures of thymocyte proliferation. Our data suggest increased tcr signalling of nave cd4 t cells in ppms without increased proliferation. We have no definite evidence as to the basis of the reduced thymic output in ms although our tcr studies raise the possibility that some unknown environmental factor / factors target(s) the thymus in r. Thymic alterations occur early in life in rrms and ppms, either at the time of ms onset or before. The thymic defect persists throughout life, as indicated by low but constant levels of thymi export with increasing age. One study of immunoablation / autologous stem cell transplantation as a treatment of ms showed that the post transplant ms patients  rebooted  their immune system. Homeostatic naive t - cell responses to early - onset thymic involution will persist throughout life in ppms and rrms. natural regulatory t cells ( ntregs) are included within the naive cd4 t subset and show disturbed development and function in spms.',\n",
       " 'The honeybee ( apis mellifera) is associated with eight characteristic bacterial species that together comprise over 95% of the gut bacteria in adult worker bees. The distinctive gut bacteria shared by honeybees and bumblebees have been implicated in defense against trypanosome parasites and in digestive roles. oxytetracycline has been widely applied to colonies of bees in the united states to control larval foulbrood diseases. We constructed a large - insert clone library ( average insert size of 34kb with total coverage of > 3 gb ) using bacterial cells from the guts of worker bees from a maryland colony. functional screens of the clone library for antibiotic resistance revealed clear instances of resistance only for tetracycline and carbenicillin. 15 of 16 ampicillin - resistant clones also grew on plates containing tetr Tracycline, indicating coselection of genes underlying resistance. Many ( 51% ) resistant clones were unique. Taxonomic assignments based on end sequences indicated that 68% of tetracycline - resistant clones are from s. alvi ( betaproteobacteria ) and 24% are from alpha1 ( alphaproteoobacteria) Most ampicillin - resistant clone encoded tetb , except for one that encoded tetd. 13 of 16 were from  alvi and three were from the related gilliamella apicola or 1c. Eight tetracycline resistance genes are widespread in american honeybee colonies but that their presence can vary among colonies or locations. tetm and tetw were typically present in bees from every colony, with few exceptions such as the absence of tety from all fl bees and of tetd from all md bees. sharply contrasting results were obtained in screens of honeybees from switzerland ( sui ) , the czech republic ( cz ) and new zealand ( nz)  resistance gene sequences were used to query scaffolds of a metagenomic sequence data set derived from the guts of bees from az ( usda ) ( 13 ) nine scaffolds were found to contain the same set of eight tetracycline resistance loci ( see table s4 in the supplemental material ) These quantitative results are broadly consistent with the results of diagnostic pcr screens and show that the gut microbiotas of sui , cz , and nz honeybees have very low copy numbers of resistance genes. We examined cultured isolates of the constituent species of the bee gut microbiota for tetracycline resistance and for the presence of resistance genes. resistant strains were readily recovered despite the absence of selection for resistance in the initial isolation procedure. resistant members of alpha1 ( 3/14 isolates ) , bifido , and firm5 species were also recovered ( see table s5 in the supplemental material ) . the observed resistance of many isolates was attributable to known tetraciesline resistance genes , often associated with large increases in the tetraticsline. ine mics of isolates from the bee gut microbiota ( see table s5 in the supplemental material ) . for strains carrying tetb ( g.  apicola wkb1 , peb0162 ) , tetc ( s.  alvi wkb2, wkb4 , wkb5 , and wkb9 ) , or tetw ( bifido wkb3) , tetracycline mICS were 12  g / ml. In contrast, mics were < 0.5  g/ ml for isolates of these species lacking resistance genes. This suggests that most resistance determinants are newly acquired and not native elements.  antibiotic perturbation may shift the gut microbiota to an alternative state that is broadly similar but different in critical aspects. these shifts could affect host health : in the case of the distinctive gut bacteria of honeybees and bumblebees. following the emergence of resistance to oxytetracycline in p.  larvae in 1996, alternative antibiotics were tested for its control. in october 2005, food and drug administration for use in beekeeping and was marketed to beekeepers. in 2007, accelerated losses of colonies occurred throughout the united states : the causes of these losses are not clear but appear not to be attributable to spread of a particular pathogen. osmid library had a total of ~1  10 fosmid clones with an average insert size of 34  kb and was estimated to represent at least 3 gb. blastx analysis of end reads of 161 randomly selected inserts against genbank and against the metagenomic sequence data set from az ( usda ) bees ( 13 ) was used to determine the representation of bacterial species within the library.

       " ' adjuvant brachytherapy is rarely used after surgical treatment due to its limited accessibility in hospitals with surgical and orthopaedic departments. It improves local control rate up to 78% , is well tolerated and rarely causes complications. The most common adverse effects include peripheral neuropathy , skin necrosis and osteonecrosis of the long bones. Surgical resection of the tumour with a safety margin of healthy tissue is the fundamental method of treatment of soft tissue sarcomas. The application of brachytherapy and chemotherapy seems to be associated with improved local control and the lower rate of recurrences. At present, an amputation is avoided and the number of these procedures performed has decreased by 20%. The patient was treated in an outpatient surgical clinic where a puncture was performed as the surgeon suspected a synovial cyst. The tumour was growing between and infiltrating three muscles : adductor magnus , sartorius and gracilis. The large size of the malignancy ( 99  78  73 mm ) , its fast growth , increasing pain and numbness in the foot forced the need of faster diagnostics and treatment.

Few studies have reported that the low thyroid hormones are independent predictors of mortality in patients admitted to intensive care units ( icu ) A total of 100 consecutive patients admitted to medical icu irrespective of the underlying diagnosis and diabetes state were included in this prospective , observational study. The patients were divided into two groups for comparison : group 1  survivors ( discharged from the hospital ) and group 2  nonsurvivors ( patients succumbed to their illness inside the hospital) Thyroid and prolactin hormones were estimated by solid phase competitive chemiluminescence and hba1c using the high performance liquid chromatography method. Free thyroid hormones were not measured in the study group to prevent the variability associated with these hormones. There was a significant linear correlation of tsh with age in the entire study population. Out of the 100 patients studied, 64 survived and discharged from the hospital whereas remaining 36 succumbed to their illness.

       " 'a bone mineral density ( bmd ) test is used to make a diagnosis of and screen for osteoporosis and to inform assessments of fracture risk. clinical practice guidelines ( cpgs ) in canada currently recommend bmd testing in specific at - risk populations. About 50% of women over 65 years of age and 81% of men have not had a bmd test. Eligible fps were english speaking, in active family practice in ontario, and had experience ordering and receiving results of bmd tests for patients. recruitment ceased as analysis of the data approached data saturation. An inductive thematic analysis was performed on the transcribed data to understand the reasons for referral for bmd testing. There was uncertainty about screening postmenopausal women in the absence of other clinical risk factors, seniors , men , and follow - up testing intervals. Almost half ( n = 10/22) of the fps were unclear about the appropriate age for baseline bmd screening for osteoporosis, particularly in men. fps indicated that they would order a bmd test for the purposes of monitoring. In our study, several fps recommended baseline screening for postmenopausal women in the absence of other risk factors. This is consistent with north american evidence demonstrating that only about 50% of senior women (i.e. 65 years of age and over ) have ever had a bmd test. In the current study , some fps indicated specifically that they had made a recent effort to refer male patients for bmd testing. inconsistent cpgs surrounding screening for osteoporosis exist within canada.  intervals for repeat testing are unclear, particularly for those with normal bmd on baseline testing. measurable bmd changes for individuals on therapy may take several years to manifest. monitoring bmd in postmenopausal women in the first three years after starting treatment with a bisphosphonate is unnecessary and may be misleading. This study acknowledges some limitations . some of the participants were initially recruited via an educational event related to osteoporosis. Future research should involve the development , implementation , and evaluation of such tools in order to assist fps in making more appropriate referrals for bmd - based screening and repeat exams. consistency among cpgs, emphasis on referral of high - risk groups as well as men , and further clarification and education on the appropriate intervals for follow - up testing are warranted.',\n",
       " 'protein interaction network around known and candidate components of the tnf/nfb pathway. traf7 contains an aminoterminal ring finger domain ( aa 125160 ) , followed by an adjacent zinc finger domain. instead of the classical traf domain , the carboxy terminus of traF7 contains seven wd40 repeats. functionally, traf 7 and mekk3 cooperate in the signal transduction pathways that lead to activation of jnk and p38 map kinases.  ubiquitin possesses seven lysines and the consequence of an ubiquitination reaction depends on the lystype of linkage. traf7 promotes predominantly lys29linked polyubiquitination of nemo , p65 , and cflip. This type of ubiquitinations is associated with lysosomal degradation of the target proteins. traF7 also binds to and stimulates sumoylation of the protooncogene product cmyb. A significant fraction of diffuse large bcell lymphoma ( dlbl) carry somatic activating mutations in traf2 ( compagno et al . , 2009) Traf2 can function as both oncogene and tumor suppressor gene. Traf4 was found overexpressed in approximately 60% of lung , breast and ovarian cancers. Meningiomas are tumors originating from the meningeal coverings of the brain and the spinal cord. expression of traf6 was found upregulated also in pancreatic cancer tissues. This resulted in deregulated expression of multiple genes involved in cell growth, apoptosis, and migration. Mutations in traf7 are observed in nearly onefourth of the meningiomas studied. Traf7 mutations are exclusive of nf2 mutations suggesting that the two proteins act along the same pathway. Cooccurring mutations in klf4 and akt1 are always the same.  malignant pleural mesothelioma ( mpm) is the most common type of mm, accounting for approximately 70% of all cases. The genes whose role has been well established in mpm are cdkn2a, nf2 ( i.e. the same gene mutated in meningiomas ) and bap1. In a recent sequencing work of transcriptomes and exomes from 216 mpms, traf7 was found among the significantly mutated genes ( 5/216 ; 2,3% ) The first evidence for an involvement of traf proteins in tumors came from the molecular analysis of specific b cells malignancies. Traf2 can function as both oncogene and tumor suppressor gene. In a larger study including epithelial tumors, traf4 was found overexpressed in approximately 60% of lung , breast and ovarian tumors. Meningiomas are tumors originating from the meningeal coverings of the brain and the spinal cord. They represent one of the most frequent primary brain tumors. A large fraction of sporadic meningiomas display recurrent genetic alterations resulting in inactivating mutations in the nf2 gene locus located on chromosome 22.  merlin regulates ubiquitination events by inhibiting the e3 ubiquitin ligase crl4(dcaf1) in the nucleus. merlin also regulates receptor signaling and cytoskeleton organization. Recent studies have led to the discovery of driver traf7 mutations implicated in meningioma tumorigenesis. Traf7/akt1/klf4 mutations predominantly localize tumors.  malignant mesothelioma ( mm) is an aggressive cancer that results from unregulated proliferation of the mesothelial cells lining the pleural, peritoneal, and pericardial cavities. mm is commonly diagnosed at advanced stages and its survival rate is lower than 12  months. The genes whose role has been well established in mpm are cdkn2a , nf2 ( i.e. , the same gene mutated in meningiomas ) , and bap1. Recent data indicate the involvement of traf7 in the genesis of various human cancers. Traf7 is mutated in about 25% of meningiomas and significantly , although at a lower rate , in human mesotheliomas. An inactivating mutation of traF7 has also been reported in a rare and aggressive cutaneous neuroendocrine carcinoma. Traf7 exerts a negative control on nfb activity by promoting ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation of nemo and that of the p65 subunit of nfb ( zotti et al . , 2011 ) The tumor suppressor protein p53 is another target of the ubiquitinating activity of traf7 and plays a critical role in breast cancer development and progression. The wd40 repeats seem to be the main hotspot for Traf7 mutations found in human cancers. Coexpression of mekk3 with traf7 results in activation of the jnk and p38 map kinases pathways. These pathways constitute a pivotal signaling pathway in cytokine and stressinduced apoptosis coherently. However , which of the multiple functions performed by traf 7 is compromised as a result of mutations found in different human tumors remains to be defined.',\n",

       " 'Spinal cord injury ( sci) is a severe traumatic injury to the central nervous system that usually results in sensation disability and paralysis. The pathogenesis of neurological diseases is associated with autoimmune or immune - related inflammatory injury. Investigation of the function of il-17 and il-23 related cytokines in spinal cord injury may reveal the pathogenesis and provide a valuable insight for the treatment of sci - related diseases. Sci (40 g    cm) was induced using the weight drop technique. rats were housed in warm cages with food and water supplied ad libitum. rats that underwent sci received specialized care consisting of manual bladder expression twice daily and cleansing for the duration of the experiment. rats from the sci group and sham - operated group were assessed for hind limb motor function at 1  h, 24  h , 48  h and 72  h after injury. Digital images of il-17 and p - stat3 immunohistochemistry were obtained using a light microscope. Total tissue protein was extracted using ripa lysate containing pmsf and 1% protease inhibitor. proteins were separated by 8% and 12% sds - page gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. membranes were blocked in tris - buffered saline and tween 20 ( tbst , ph 7.6 ) containing 5% fbs for 1  h. The pcr products were blasted in the ncbi blast bank and sequenced by sangon biotech co. , ltd ( shanghai , china ) for plasma preparation. The concentration of il-6 , il-21 , and il-23 was measured using elisa kits ( huamei , wuhan ) . 96-well microtiter plates and other reagents were incubated at room temperature prior to use for 30  min. The mean bbb scores of the sci group were lower than the sham group at 1  h, 24  h , 48  h and 72  h after injury. The structural integrity of the spinal cord was damaged and the weight hit locations showed a strong compression phenomenon. Staining revealed a progressive increase in inflammatory cell expression at sites of injury and neuronal damage. Western blotting analyses to determine activation of the stat3 signaling pathway after sci. antibodies against p - stat3 detected a single protein band in the crude samples of injured spinal cord. densitometric analysis of p -stat3 at tyr705 bands revealed an increased expression after sci immediately , peaking at 24  h. -17 concentrations showed a positive correlation with the level of il-23p19 ( r = 0.6213 ) in spleen tissue following sci. traumatic spinal cord injury results in the disruption of neural and vascular structures, which leads to inflammation. An enhanced understanding of inflammation will preserve spinal cord tissue and neurons better. The most common type of sci in the clinical practice is contusive spinal cord injury. The weight drop rat model of sci described by allen is the most appropriate model to assess the acute sci. Compared to the sham - operated group, the sci group exhibited marked neurons and organizational structure damage in the spinal cord tissues. The positive expression of il-17 and p - stat3 were both concentrated in the spinal cord neurons and astrocyte cells. We demonstrated that the stat3 signaling pathway was activated and induced by sci. The inflammatory response is an essential component of the repair process after spinal cord injury. In the neuroinflammation of sci , il-6, il-21 , and il-23 are produced in large quantities. These changes are more conductive to the production of il-17 and lead to immune disorder and promotion of sci. An interconnected loop is formed among spinal cord neuro inflammation factors.',\n",

The stretching technique began with 5 seconds of isometric contraction of the muscle. ion and extension18 . all measurements were done three times : before intervention , at 4 week , and at 8 week. respiratory function did not change noticeably when measured before the  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 intervention and after 8 weeks of intervention. as for spinal curve and movement , her thoracic kyphosis curve decreased , whereas her lumbar lordosis curve and spinal movement gradually increased as the intervention progressed. In this study , a case study was conducted to examine the effect of thoracic cage of joint mobilization and stretching on respiratory function. The patient s respiratory function did not change noticeably because of her advanced age, long duration of her disease, and her underweight condition in terms of bmi. respiratory muscle strength exercise or electrical stimulation is recommended in copd patients. As thoracic kyphosis grows more severe, spine extensor muscles weaken7 ; thus , stretching and extensor muscle exercise is necessary. stretching was used in this study which involves hold - relax of the agonist muscle followed by contraction of the antagonist muscle. this stretches the flexor muscles of the front part of the trunk that had been shortened due to a distorted posture. It also strengthens extensor. muscles on the back part of trunk, which resulted in decreased thoraco-kyphosis.',\n",
       " 'inflammatory bowel disease ( ibd) comprises a myriad of different presentations , levels of severity and responses to treatment. pediatric ibd represents more extensive inflammation with a predilection for colitis. ibd is an immune - mediated inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract arising out of a host immune dysregulation with genetic and environmental influences. After negative stool studies for infection , due to persistent hematochezia , she underwent endoscopy that revealed left - sided colitis with erythematous friable mucosa. She was started on balsalazide ( 750 mg by mouth 3 times daily ) with some improvement , but ultimately required steroid suppositories ( rectacort 2 times a day for 2 weeks ) for complete resolution of her rectal bleeding. Pancreatic involvement in ibd may also be a part of a common immune disorder whereby the target cells of gut epithelium and pancreas share a similar molecular structure lending themselves to antigenic mimicry. Another remote possibility is cryptogenic hyperlipasemia without pancreatitis where macrolipase or immunoglobulin linked enzymes are suggested to be induced by autoimmune mechanisms.  clinical symptoms of ibd - associated pancreatitis are found in approximately 2% of patients. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency has been reported in 2180% patients and histological changes observed in 3853% of postmortem pathological exams. Subclinical or silent pancreatitis may be masked by symptoms attributed to ibd.',\n",
       " 'protein arginine methyltransferases ( prmts) comprise a group of enzymes that catalyze the transfer of methyl groups to the amino acid. Prmts have been shown to function as transcriptional activators and repressors. Recently, reports suggest that prMts function as regulators of fuel metabolism through interaction with a number of transcriptional regulators in the pathway. Prmt is a transcription factor with a forkhead box domain that is conserved in various eukaryotic species. It is expressed ubiquitously in most tissues and may account for up to 85% of all prmt activity in the cell. It can also function as a coactivator of transcription factors by direct modification of arginine residues on the transcription factors themselves. Liver - specific depletion of foxo1 in mice reduced glucose production in vivo. prmt1 was shown to modulate asymmetric dimethylation of Foxo1 at arginines 248 and 250 in the mouse liver. Prmt1 disturbed the ability of insulin to reduce glucoseProduction in the liver. Prmt4 controls hepatic gluconeogenesis by interacting with creb in hepatocytes. Prmt5 is a type ii prmt that promotes symmetric dimethylation of arginine residues in substrates. prmt5 was shown to specifically interact with crtc2 , a creb coactivator that enhances creb.  recruitment of prmt5 to the promoters of pepck and g6pase in turn promotes increased symmetric dimethylation of histone h3 at arginine 2 ( h3r2) This leads to increased lysine modification of the same histones by wd repeat - containing protein 5 ( wdr5)-containing lysin methyl transferase complexes. Prmt5 can potentiate the repressor activity of small heterodimer partner ( shp ) by direct methylation of this protein at ar ginine 57. methylated shp in turn recruits transcriptional corepressors, including brm and sin3a. mt6 restored normal glycemia in these mouse models. This underscores the importance of prmt6 in the control of crtc2-dependent gluconeogenic transcription in vivo. We also observed similar modification of arginine residues in other crtc proteins by prMT6. All of the prmts known to be involved in the. control of hepatic glucose metabolism ( prmt4, prmt5, and prmt 6) affect the transcriptional activity of creb - crtc.2- dependent machinery.',\n",
       " 'type 1 diabetes mellitus ( t1 dm) is identified by the progressive autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells. transplantation of human cadaveric pancreas or allogeneic islet cells could be considered therapeutic in this condition. mesenchymal stem cells ( mscs) represent a rare heterogeneous subset of multipotent stromal cells localized in many different adult and fetal tissues. Mesenchymal stem cells due to their low immunogenicity and immunomodulatory properties as well as high degree of differentiation and proliferation potential might be useful in inhibiting the autoimmunity and regenerating the insulin - secreting cells. This study may provide some basic information regarding application of human mscs in treating type 1 diabetes. The at - mscs at passage 3 were detached with 0.25% trypsin / edta and resuspended to 5  10 cells in pbs. The cells were then fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde ( sigma ) and analyzed using a facs calibur flow cytometer ( bd biosciences , san diego , ca ) and cyflogic software ( cyflo ltd . ) . The at-mscs were analyzed for their ability to differentiate into osteoblast , adipocyte , and chondrocyte. Pancreas was excised from c57bl/6 mice under sterile conditions and minced into small pieces. enzymatic digestion of the pancreatic tissue was fulfilled by collagenase type xi in 37c water bath for 20  min with interim agitation. digested contents were filtered through 500 and 100  m cell strainers to capture the islets and allow the small exocrine cells to pass. islet cells lysate was prepared by freezing and thawing 10 islets in 0.5  ml of rpmi-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fbs. splenocytes were extracted using a 5  ml syringe with a 23  g needle and counted and viability was assessed by 0.2 At - mscs at passage 3 were harvested and adjusted to 2.5  10 cells per well for coculture with at-mscs. 100  l of fresh medium containing 5 l of mitomycin - c ( 1  g/l ; sigma ) was added for 1  h at 37c to mitotically inactivate the at - mSCs. after that medium was removed and inactivated at -mscS were washed twice with pbs. At - mScs were resuspended in 100 L of mixed culture medium and stimulated by 5  g / ml pha ( 10  l ) or 10  L of islet cells lysate in control and test groups. In order to examine the proliferation of splenocytes ( in the presence of at - mscs ) , at-mscs monoculture was used as blank to subtract background absorbance. To provide the optimum condition , the mtt assay was repeated several times. The supernatants of each group were collected and evaluated by multi - analyte elisarray kit ( mem-003a , sabiosciences) In this study, diabetic mice model was developed by administration of multiple low - doses of stz. blood glucose levels of 300 mg / dl were monitored within 1 week of stZ treatment. pancreatic islets destruction was confirmed by histopathological examination. At - mscs were able to differentiate toward osteogenic , adipogenic , and chondrogenic lineages. more than 80% of all cells stained positively with alcian blue showed the glucose amino glycan biosynthesis. At - mscs could inhibit proliferation of splenocytes that were triggered by pha as a nonspecific stimulator. The greater cell death seemed to occur at the highest density of at-mscs. No significant difference was detected between normal and diabetic splenocyte in the pattern of reduced proliferation and response to mitogen. At - mscs were cocultured with islet lysate - stimulated splenocytes as previously described and cell proliferation was assessed. diabetic cells showed a significant proliferation ( figure 2 ; p < 0.05 ) . again , the dose - dependent effect of at-mscs on diabetic splenocyte proliferation inhibition was observed. At the lowest dilution tested ( 1  :  50 ) , more significant inhibition ofsplenocytes proliferation was observed . however , the results demonstrated that at - mScs could induce cell death in some of these splen cells. Adult multipotent stem cells represent a fibroblast - like morphology that have the capacity to differentiate into several tissues. mscs induce peripheral tolerance and migrate to injured tissues where they can inhibit release of proinflammatory cytokines and promote the survival of damaged cells. although many researchers have demonstrated the immunomodulatory activities of mSCs , in vitro potential assays able to predict or to correlate with therapeutic outcome of mscS are still partially known. Mscs were isolated from different tissues. The shared immunophenotype and differential characteristics were identified. The biological characteristics similar to bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell ( bm - mscs) indicate that at-mscs may present an alternative source for future application. At - mscs had a suppressive effect on splenocytes proliferation in the presence of specific ( islet cells lysate ) and nonspecific ( pha ) stimulators. The most inhibition was seen at the lowest dilution tested ( 1  :  50 ; p < 0.05 ) However, at - mScs could induce cell death in some splenocyte in this concentration. Similar effects of at - Mscs were observed in the Presence of islet lysates and pha. In the absence of at - mscs, normal and diabetic splenocytes in response to nonspecific stimulator ( pha) showed similar fashion. In contrast, in response of islet lysate normal splenocyte were not responsive, whereas a sharp proliferation was obtained in diabeticsplenocytes ( p < 0.05 ) The increases in regulatory cytokines were significantly prominent in at-mscs cocultured with lysates - stimulated diabeticSplenocytes. In this study we used other approaches of mscs properties to maintain in vitro viability and functionality of purified islets in the presence of reactive splenocytes. In this approach , it was found that at-mscs in coculture design had ability to provide islet functionality. This was proven by protected insulin secretion in coc culture medium ( p < 0.05 ) This study may provide some basic information regarding application of human mscs in treating type 1 diabetes. of islet cells in the presence of reactive splenocytes . although we note that adjunct in vivo studies are required to completely investigate the immunomodulatory functions of m Scs in autoimmune diseases.',\n",
       " \"expenditures for the medicaid program grew at an average annual rate of nearly 20 percent between 1989 and 1992. These dramatic increases in medicaid expenditures constituted a significant fiscal burden to the federal government and the states. The states blamed federal eligibility expansions for creating enrollment and , consequently, expenditure growth that the states could not control. Two federal medicaid policies, the boren amendment and the nursing home provisions of the omnibus budget reconciliation act ( obra ) of 1987 , may have contributed directly to medicaid expenditure growth. Other factors, such as the economy and the prevalence of aids, may also have contributed significantly to expenditures. The relative contribution of these factors has not been systematically analyzed in the literature. This article attempts to contribute to the literature by empirically analyzing the determinations. ants of medicaid expenditure growth from 1984 to 1992 . the analysis uses cross - sectional time - series data from 49 states and the district of columbia to estimate a model ofMedicaid expenditures with fixed state effects. the analysis separately estimates models of expenditures for four categories of medic aid enrollees : adults ( under 65 years of age ) , children , the blind and disabled , and the elderly. Medicaid expenditures and income are consistently found to have a positive relationship. This analysis attempts to improve on prior measures of the tax price of providing medicaid services by explicitly accounting for tax exportation. exported taxes are defined as funds from sources other than the federal government or a state 's taxpayers that could be used to finance a medicaid program. The analysis includes three broad categories of independent variables : federal medicaid policy , state policy , and enrollment and other factors. The federal policy variables represent obra 1987 's nursing home provisions and the boren amendment. The state policy variables are derived from the median voter model. The tax price to the median voters of providing medicaid services is reduced by funds from other sources. severance taxes and corporate taxes are among the most important sources of tax exports. Enrollment models were estimated for adults , children , the blind and disabled , and the aged. Federal policy variables, notably low - income eligibility expansions and the qmb program, were significantly related to enrollment. Tax price, the size of the relevant poverty population, afdc participation variables, and the governor's political party were also considered. State - level medicaid spending grew dramatically but varied significantly across states. Average annual growth rates from 1989 to 1992 ranged from a low of 10 percent in pennsylvania and rhode island to a high of 78 percent in new hampshire. T&d programs and the prevalence of aids are also found to be significantly related to expenditures. 45 percent of the growth in total medicaid recipients from 1988 to 1992. These groups accounted for only 9 percent of expenditure growth. This figure does not support the contention that the eligibility expansions were the driving force behind the dramatic growth in medicaid expenditures. The boren amendment 's impact on total expenditures for the blind and disabled and the aged is greater than for adults and children. A republican governorship is associated with significantly greater expenditures than a democratic governorship. This result raises questions about the commonly accepted supposition that democrats are  big spenders and that republicans are not. The prevalence of aids was found to be positively and significantly related to expenditures for adult enrollees. aid recipients, enrollees , and expenditures . the analysis includes three broad categories of independent variables : federal medicaid policy, state policy , and enrollment and other factors. The federal policy variables represent obra 1987 's nursing home provisions and the boren amendment. The state policy variables are derived from the median voter model : tax price, tax capacity , and the governor 's political party ( as a measure of a state's political ideology) Enrollment models were estimated for adults , children , the blind and disabled , and the aged using state - level data from 1984 - 92. Federal policy variables, notably low - income eligibility expansions and the qmb program, were significantly related to enrollment. In addition, tax price , the size of the relevant poverty population , afdc participation variables , and aids were found to be significant. State - level medicaid spending grew dramatically but varied significantly across states. average annual growth rates from 1989 to 1992 ranged from a low of 10 percent in pennsylvania and rhode island to a high of 78 percent in new hampshire. The results indicate that total medicaid expenditures for each enrollment group and almost all categories of expenditures significantly increase as the group 's enrollment increases. From 1992 to 1993, enrollment growth accounted for 67 percent of expenditure growth. From 1991 to 1992, enrollment accounted for just over 30 percent of expenditures growth. Other federal medicaid policies made a statistically significant contribution to medicaid expenditure growth from 1984 to 1992. The influence of state policy determinants is more evident for category of service expenditures than for total expenditures. A republican governorship is associated with significantly greater expenditures than a democratic governorship. This result raises questions about the commonly accepted supposition that democrats are  big spenders and that republicans are not. The prevalence of aids was found to be positively and significantly related to expenditures for adult enrollees. Many of the factors that the literature hypothesizes to have contributed to medicaid expenditure growth in recent years were found to have a significant impact on expenditure growth from 1984 to 1992. Medicaid expenditures grew by 10 percent from 1992 to 1993, nearly one - half the average annual growth rate from 1989 - 92. The impact of some factors should be subsiding because the mandated eligibility expansions for low - income infants, children, and pregnant women are largely implemented. However, the relative contribution of various factors to expenditure growth is shifting. Future research might consider the effects of specific state policy variables rather than state policy determinants. In fixed - effects models of the type estimated here , much of the variation in expenditures is essentially absorbed by the state intercepts. It also suggests areas for future research . for example , future research might Consider the Effects of Specific State Policy variables.\",\n",

       " 'chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd) is characterized by airflow limitation that is usually progressive and associated with chronic airway inflammatory response. One of the systemic manifestations that affect these patients is related to cardiac autonomic modulation. Patients with copd have changes in this modulation that play an important role in the morbidity and mortality of these patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cardiac autonomic modulation through hrv after an acute session of re at different intensities in copd patients. The experimental protocol comprised an initial assessment and the assessment of autonomic function against re of 60% and 90% of the one repetition maximum test ( 1rm ) , which was performed on subsequent days. For the determination of 1rm , subjects had three to five attempts at intervals ranging between 3 to 5 minutes ( min ) The final load at which they managed to perform the exercise without mechanical failure was established as a maximum load. Patients hr was recorded beat - by - beat using a polar s810i hr monitor ( polar electro , kempele ) Data from 12 copd patients were analyzed. Patients had to have undergone spirometry and received a medical diagnosis of the disease. Only series with more than 95% sinus beats were included in the study. manual filtering to eliminate ectopic premature beats and artifacts. statistical significance was set at 5% for all analyses. All procedures of this study were approved by the ethics committee of the institution ( caae : 00849812.0.5402 ) and all patients signed an informed consent form. The experimental protocol comprised an initial assessment and the assessment of autonomic function against re of 60% and 90% of the one repetition maximum test ( 1rm) Heart rate ( hr) was recorded beat - by - beat using a polar s810i hr monitor. 256 consecutive rr intervals were selected for each time the hrv was assessed. Only series with more than 95% sinus beats were included in the study. hrv indexes were measured at the following times : baseline / rest, immediately after sessions , and after 48 hours. The patients anthropometric characteristics , their spirometric values , and their basal blood pressure values are described in table 1. 64% used angiotensin receptor antagonists, 9% diuretics , 27% hypolipidemics , 9% anti - inflammatories , and 9%Anti - allergic agents. No significant differences in rates between the protocols were observed. Several studies have described the behavior of hrv after aerobic exercise,3639 but few show the response of autonomic function after re. The authors found an increased sympathetic activity and decreased parasympathetic activity during the post - exercise recovery period. regardless of the intensity of the performed exercise, the recovery of\\xa0 autonomic\\xa0modulation in these patients is similar. Lf index during recovery is influenced by changes in parasympathetic activity. The lf / hf ratio has been shown to increase from 20 to 30 min after exercise and may remain elevated for up to 60 min post - exercise,23,45,46. The results also showed that regardless of the intensity of the exercises performed , autonomic modulation recovery is similar. The results indicate that acute sessions of re impact on autonomic modulation in copd patients by promoting differences in the recovery period compared to baseline.

       " 'varicocele is characterized by retrograde flow in testicular veins pathophysiologically and is manifested clinically by abnormal tortuosity and dilatation of the spermatic veins and pampiniform plexus. It affects 15% of the general population and is especially common among teenagers and young adults. Some varicoceles are impalpable and asymptomatic and are diagnosed only with ultrasound evaluation owing to thick scrotal skin. All cdu studies were performed by three experienced physicians using the same equipment ( 7.5-mhz electronic linear probe , prosound alpha5sv , aloca co. , tokyo , japan ) We placed the transducer transversely on the bilateral scrotal surface with the patients in a supine position with the abdomen and chest elevated to about 15. diameters of the largest vein in the pampiniform plexus were measured bilaterally during resting and during a valsalva maneuver. ine position at rest , the mmvd of varicocele testis units was 1.8 mm ( grade i ) , 2.0 mm (grade ii ) , and 2.5 mm (Grade iv) compared with normal testis. Only grade ii varicoceles showed a significant difference ( p=0.004) in the supine position during the valsalva maneuver, mmvd was 3.0mm (grade i ) and 4.2mm ( grade iv) Ultrasonography and particularly cdu appear to be the most reliable and practical methods for diagnosing subclinical varicocele. The reliability of cdu to diagnose varicoceles remains controversial and the diagnostic criteria remain poorly def ined. The change in color is subjective and unreliable for the diagnosis of reflux in cdu examination. A new scoring system to improve cdu criteria to diagnose scrotal varicocele was proposed by chiou et al. However, their measures were obtained only in the supine position. Physical examination alone is not a highly reliable tool in the diagnosis ofvaricocele. Use of venography is inappropriate for routine screening. The valsalva maneuver has a greater role in dilation of the pampiniform plexus in the standing position than in the supine position. mmvds of normal testis units were 1.80.9 mm , 1.81.2 mm , and 2.50.3 mm , respectively. The resting - valsalva ratio in the standing position could be a new and ancillary diagnostic index for varicocele diagnosis by use of scrotal cdu. The resting-valsalvo ratio could be used to identify the pampiniform plexus in a patient.',\n",
       " 'Behavioral addictions ( bas) in association with dopamine agonists ( das) have been reported. The us food & drug administration s ( fda) adverse event reporting system ( faers) conducted a retrospective disproportionality analysis based on the 2.7 million serious domestic and foreign ades reported to the faers from 2003 to 2012. They identified 1,580 reports containing at least one ba, 710 of which also contained a da.  moore et  al. ( 2014) briefly allude to the issue of publicity in their discussion and suggest that it can not account for their findings. They characterize growth in ba w / da reporting ( dopamine receptor agonists in figure 1 ) between 2003 and 2012 as steady. They conclude that it is therefore unlikely that a burst of publicity or specific events explain their findings . Of the 35 included news stories, 15 were precipitated by scientific publications ( 43% ) ; 10 by lawsuits ( 29%) ; 7 by conference presentations ( 20%) ; 1 by a change in pharmaceutical company advertising ( 3%) ; and 1 for which the catalyst was unclear ( 3% ) . results are summarized in figure 2. The approximately 588% growth in ba w / da reporting observed between 2005 and 2009 coincides with the publication of 26 news stories.  pathological gambling / gambling was also the ba most frequently reported to the faers between 2003 and 2012. While publicity may influence reporting , it is also possible that faers reporting may have led to increased publicity , perhaps indirectly through analysis and reporting of findings. of the 35 news stories included in the analysis, one cites as its catalyst an update to possible adverse events listed in a product s television advertisements. A ba / da association has received considerable publicity since it was first reported in 2003. Data suggest that publicity may stimulate ade reporting, and in this case it may coincide with fluctuations in ba w / da reporting. The notion that reporting of bas in association with das might be influenced by publicity has important clinical and public health implications , and is thus not a notion that should be prematurely dismissed.

       " 'polycystic ovarian syndrome ( pcos) is one of the most common endocrine disorders among women of the reproductive age. It is commonly undiagnosed due to the fact that its symptoms are heterogeneous and seem to have no relation with each other. obesity is a common symptom of pcos although its cause still remains unknown. We hypothesized that obesity and pcos both independently and synergistically cause insulin resistance. Women with amenorrhea ( cycle interval  6 months ) and/or midluteal progesterone level 15  nmol / l were considered anovulatory. pregnancy, breast feeding, intercurrent illness , the use of any medication that could affect insulin metabolism , smoking , recent infection less than ten days prior to inclusion , and creatinine clearance 60  ml / min were exclusion criteria. A priming dose of insulin was given over the first 10 minutes followed by a constant infusion rate of 80  mu / m / min up to the 120th minute. 10% dextrose solution was infused as from the 11th minute at variable rates modifiable every 5 minutes using an infusion pump. capillary blood sugar measurements were done with a glucometer and strips. The median fat mass and lean mass were significantly higher in obese pcos subjects than in nonobese pcos. subjects ( p = 0.0003) Other parameters significantly higher were waist circumference and body fat percentage. The clamp - derived m value adjusted for lean body mass expressed in mg / kg / min was lower in both obese andnonobese people living with pcos than in healthy subjects.  insulin response to an oral glucose load is higher in lean and obese pcos women compared to healthy ones. This clearly signifies that, irrespective of the presence or absence of obesity, insulin resistance is associated with pcos. The lower insulin sensitivity in obese women shows that though obesity may not be the only cause of insulin resistance in pcos subjects, it worsens the insulin resistance. Weight loss in obese subjects even without other therapeutic agents can restore insulin sensitivity. The lack of a difference between the groups suggests that poor lifestyle habits ( such as diet and inactivity ) may remain the main predisposing factor of the obesity in pcos women. dietary intervention and increased physical activity can significantly help to improve insulin sensitivity and obesity in women living with pcos.',\n",
       " 'neuroinflammation is the mechanism of cns inflammation that occurs in response to trauma , infections , and/or neurodegenerative diseases. In neuroinflammation, cellular and molecular immune components such as specialised macrophages ( microglia ) , cytokines , complement , and pattern - recognition receptors are the contributing players. These proinflammatory mediators are either produced locally within the cns or recruited from the peripheral system.  activation of microglia by tlrs and nlrs is considered to be classical microglial activation where innate immune responses include production of proinflammatory cytokines. classical activation also leads to adaptive immune response by expressing major histocompatibility class ii molecules and interaction with t cells. tnf- stimulation increases phagocytic activity ofmicroglia and deficiency of tnF receptors has been found to reduce microglian activation.  reactive astrogliosis is associated with a number of cns diseases such as ad, pd, autism, and prion diseases. astrocytes have been shown to express innate immune prr like tlr, nlr, scavenger , complement , and mannose receptors. tlr is a type 1 membrane protein containing an extracellular leucine - rich repeat ( lrr ) domain and a toll / il-1 receptor ( tir ) domain in the cytoplasmic region. lrr domain is involved in specific pathogen recognition   and tir domain isinvolved in the signalling pathway. Tlr proteins are recruited by tir domain leading to activation of nf-. nf- then induces production of proinflammatory cytokines such as tnf- , il-1 , and il-6 , and chemokines. All tlrs are activated by myd88 except tlr3. Myd88 may be restricting tlr 3 signalling. Other adaptors investigated in detail include major histocompatibility complex class ii molecules.  tlr2 and tlr9 initiate immune response against herpes simplex virus ( hsv ) and also control hsv infection in the brain. tlr3 in astrocytes may be protective in hsv2 infection and has been reported to mediate entry of west nile virus ( wnv ) into the cns. myd88 pathway may also be involved in pd where -synuclein directly activates microglia and alters expression of tlrs. Like tlrs , nod - like receptors ( nlrs) also detect pamps and damps. They consist of a central nucleotide - binding and oligomerisation ( nacht ) domain and a c - terminal lrrs. upon binding to agonists , nlr can lead to the activation of nf- or mapk signalling pathways and production of cytokines and chemokines.  nlrp1 has been found to be involved in tbi and neutralising its effect or formation was found to have beneficial effects. Nlrp3 inflammasome contributes to brain injury in pneumococcal meningitis and is associated with inflammation in japanese encephalitis. inhibition of these inflammaomes was beneficial in reversing ethanol - mediated neuroinflammation. microglia express sr and thus bind to a fibrils associated with ad plaques. The complement system comprises of more than 30 proteins in the serum as well as membrane - bound receptors and regulators. The complement system consists of 3 different initiating or activation pathways culminating into a final common lytic pathway. The functions of the complement system include opsonisation of pathogens , direct lysis of foreign cells , chemotaxis and activation of leukocytes.  complement is produced mainly in the liver and it is well known that components of innate immunity like complement are present and even produced within the cns. role of complement in cns is considered to be dual - neurotoxic and/or neuroprotective , depending on the level of its activation. C1q and c3 genetically deficient mice each showed considerably high bacterial titres in cns as compared to wild - type mice. streptococcus pneumonia infection of cns is kept in check by complement system. infectious particles called prions cause cns disorders like creutzfeldt - jakob disease and bovine spongiform encephalopathy.  activated complement components c1q , c3d , and c4d have been detected in amyloid plaques by immunohistochemistry. microglia are found in and around plaques of ad brains and are found to express c 1q and complement receptors c1Qr , cr3 , cr4 , and  c5ar. inhibition of complement was found to be associated with an increased formation of plaque and neurodegeneration. Neuromelanin ( nm) is a pigment that accumulates in dopaminergic neurons in normal aging process. In pd , these dopamergic neurons are susceptible to degeneration. This is thought to be caused by activation of microglia by nm. This nm pigment is found to be opsonised by c1q and phagocytosed by c 1q - positivemicroglia. A detailed understanding of the processes and mechanisms involved in the etiopathogenesis of cns diseases is essential and can pave the way for reducing excessive neuroinflammation and its effects. modulation of cellular processes and phenotypes looks increasingly likely to be a way forward in combating cns disorders.',\n",
       " 'Nucleic acid testing ( nat) is a newer technology introduced in the field of transfusion medicine for molecular diagnosis and characterisation of viral infections. nat combines the advantages of direct and highly sequence - specific detection of viral genomes ( dna or rna ) with an analytic sensitivity that is several orders of magnitude greater than that of antigen / antibody / antigen - antibody detection techniques. The pue is a multiplex nat assay designed to detect hiv-1/hiv-2 , hbv , and hcv qualitatively in vitro. We evaluated the pue on the fully automated procleix panther system and compared the results with routine serology and the earlier pua. A total of 10,015 routine blood donations at our blood bank were screened for viral markers. A total of 213 donations were found out to be reactive for either of the viral markers tested by either serology or nat ( both pua and pue ) The overall prevalence of viral markers was 1.44% for hbv, 0.4% for  hcv , 0.25% for\\xa0 hiv , and 5 ( 0.05% ) coinfections. Of all the nat yield cases, 3 were positive by both pua and pue assays and 18 were reactive only by pue. 17 hbv yields were occult infections and 1 was window period ( wp yield ) infection. The introduction of improved id - nat and serology tests measuring pathogen - specific humoral immune responses in the donor led to safer blood supply. In 9 out of 21 nat yield cases , viral load could not be quantified. The results were in agreement with the claims of the manufacturer stating that newer pue has enhanced capability of target capture along with increase in lod in comparison to the pua. Our study suggests that for endemic regions with high prevalence of hbv, inclusion of nat to routine serology is a better alternative than and equally , if not more , inclusion of tti screening.  quantitative pcr failed to quantify the viral loads of the hcv specific nat yield samples. The detection of hiv-2 may have serious repercussions on the blood supplies. The strengthening of screening tests with incorporation of modern testing techniques and rigorous donor selection are the only remaining alternatives for developing nations to increase the blood safety. The pue has enhanced sensitivity ( as measured in terms of nat yields ) compared to pua for hbv and hcv. full automation , reduced workspace and infrastructure requirements with increased sensitivity and hiv-2 detection are additional advantages of the newer system. Since most of the yield cases were of hbV , introduction of pue id - nat screening in india will reduce transmission of hBv.',\n",

It usually locates at the lower extremities ( 80% of cases ) ( table 1) An involvement of the femoral vein by tumoral clots was not evident in our case. The tumoral cells are characterized by a specific ( x ; 18 ) ( p11 ; q11 ) translocation with a resulting fusion gene ( syt  ssx1, ssx2 , ssx4 ) that is an exclusive marker for the immunohistochemical diagnosis of ss. The mri usually shows a mass ( frequently larger than 5 cm ) located near a joint at the lower extremities with an inhomogeneous intensity on t2-weighted images. Many authors recommend considering ss in the differential diagnosis in cases of tumoral mass located at the lower extremities. A multidisciplinar team that must be confident with this kind of sts is required for a better pre - surgical planning and for a wishful long - term follow - up.',\n",
       " 'The true incidence of different types of chronic rhinitis in kazakhstan children and adolescents is not known because there is no generally accepted standard criterion of its diagnosis. immunotherapy is the only etiology - based treatment that has the potential for disease modification. The study was conducted during pollen season from the beginning of may to the end of october in two consequent years 2010 and 2011. Allergic rhinitis was diagnosed in 81 ( 65.3% ) cases of 124 patients. The most common nasal decongestants that were used by patients were imidazolines. Symptoms of chronic infectious rhinosinusitis included mucopurulent nasal discharge, facial pain and pressure, olfactory disturbance and postnasal drainage.  skin prick test results ( table 3) revealed a high sensitization level to the weed plant pollen among allergic children and adolescents. The mean ige level in blood tests was 323.2264.9sd with minimum of 31 iu / ml and maximum of 990 iu/ml. rhinitis medicamentosa was diagnosed in 47 ( 37.9% ) of the total amount of patients. Nasal mucosa had hyperemia with bleeding zones in 29 ( 61.7% ) of the patients. edema with sick mucous in 9 ( 19.1% ) and pale mucous with atrophy zones and dry crusts were formed in 8 ( 17.0%) of patients with rhinitis medicamentosa of more than two years duration. after 6 weeks of treatment we found that nasal symptoms severity with anterior rhinoscopy results improved and the patency of nasal airways were achieved. Non - allergic rhinitis was found more frequently among women and associated with headaches and sinusitis. In countries with hot and humid climate like iran the pattern of sensitization to environmental allergens as in other reports from arabian peninsula was shown. The most common allergens are house dust mites and cockroaches. The incidence of rhinitis medicamentosa does not significantly depend on baseline cause of nasal blockage but depends on duration of decongestants use and their type. The study has some limitations : all children and adolescents were recruited from the same allergological center , thus forming a small sample size that may restrict generalization of the findings.',\n",

The mean score for ui knowledge was highest among physicians and lowest among physical therapists. There was no relationship between the mean knowledge score and length of work experience in a long - term care hospital. Practice behaviors of nurses seemed to be better than those of other healthcare providers. Although urologic health issues including ui are common in long - term care hospitals , the medical interventions for these issues may be insufficient. An efficient system of collaboration with urologists should be developed to improve health outcomes in long-term care facilities. This study is the first study to assess the current management status of patients with urologic issues and to report ui knowledge and practice behaviors among korean healthcare providers in long - term care hospitals. systematic collaboration between these providers and urologics specialists should be recommended to improve quality of care.',\n",

In spite of advances in imaging modalities and clinical experience with this entity since its first description in 1862 , several issues regarding its diagnosis and management still remain unresolved. obular sized artery , consistent with cholesterol atheroemboli. tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis involved about 40% of the cortex. no refractile crystals were noted in frozen sections of biopsy core submitted for direct immunofluoroscence ( dif ) studies. Aerd has a variable , but definite temporal relationship to invasive vascular procedures and use of thrombolytic and anticoagulant therapy. The mechanism involves dissolution of superficial clots which destabilize the ruptured atherosclerotic plaques. The gold standard of diagnosing aerd remains the demonstration of atheroemboli in renal vasculature in a renal biopsy. Use of steroids in aerd is not clear , but may be related to the suppression of reactive inflammation often seen along with the atheromatous plaques. pulse steroid therapy appears to be an effective modality and may be offered as a first line treatment in patients with aerd.',\n",
       " 'partial resection of the fibula is mainly done for using fibula as a graft or for osteomyelitis , fibular tumors , or in cases of trauma with severe bone loss. It has been shown to cause ankle pain in 1040% of patients, ankle instability, muscle weakness , and in some cases, functional loss and ankle ectropion malformation in pediatric age groups. There are few clear - cut guidelines based on cadaveric biomechanical studies to substantiate the fact. The specimens were stored at 20c and defrosted at room temperature 12 h before the experiment. We performed normal condition testing ( no fibula resection)for every specimen and demarcated the beginning and ending positions of planned fibular osteotomy by placing a mark on the fibular bone. After cutting the skin and subcutaneous fascia , blunt dissection of muscles was carried out using the intermuscular plane to access the fibula. The length of resected fibula was measured and recorded. A flexible electronic pressure sensor ( k - scan model 5033 , 3500 psi ; tekscan , inc . , boston , ma , usa ) was selected for the purpose of measurement. The skin of anterior wall of the joint capsule of the ankle was incised and the subcutaneously soft tissue was carefully separated to reveal the ankle cavity. While carrying out the dissections , care was taken to ensure that the muscle tendon tissues in front of the Joint capsule were not damaged. The pressure sensor was then implanted into the ankle cavities ensuring that the implanting position was correct. The fibula was osteotomized at the indicated place using a gigli saw. The skin of anterior wall of the joint capsule of the ankle was incised and the subcutaneously soft tissue was carefully separated to reveal the ankle cavity. A flexible electronic pressure sensor ( k - scan model 5033 , 3500 psi ; tekscan , inc . , boston , ma , usa ) was selected for the purpose of measurement. In all three cases of fibular resection at different levels ( proximal, middle , and distal third ) , the contact area of tibiotalar joint had a significant change ( p < 0.05 ) with a decreasing trend. with increasing level of osteotomy , in higher levels , as a corollary , the peak pressure also had asignificant change. The studies done in the past have demonstrated that there is biomechanical impact of the procedure on the ankle joint. The amount and exact degree of the resection have not been quantified in detail in various biomechanical studies that have been conducted. It remains to be conclusively proven whether the fusion of distal tibiofibular joints has an impact on the functional outcome and any improvement in biomechanics. When osteotomized at the distal third portion of the fibula, there are significant differences in tibiotalar joint contact area and crest value stress compared with the complete fibula. If doing bone grafting and more than middle 1/3 of fibula needs resection , the proper fixation methods should be performed using screws and graft to ensure the tibioticar joint stability.

       " 'naturally produced biopolymers in living organisms play crucial roles in materials discovery and development. They have inspired scientists to synthesize novel biomaterials through mimicking mother nature. cellular membranes have also been widely imitated by phospholipids and polysaccharides to form liposomes for drug and imaging agent delivery.  melanin is a typical biomarker for disease imaging including melanoma detection  and parkinson diseases diagnosis. By mimicking natural melanin , water - soluble melanin nanoparticle ( mnp) has been synthesized and used as the active platform for multimodal imaging of tumors.  melanin granules were first dissolved in 0.1 n naoh aqueous solution and then neutralized under sonication to obtain melanin nanoparticles in high water monodispersity and homogeneity. After peg surface - modification, rgd was further attached to the mnp for tumor targeting. Then fe and/or cu were chelated to the obtained mnps for pai / mri / pet  multimodal imaging. The h nmr spectrum of pws - mnp in d2o showed no obvious signal belonging to the hydrogen atom on the arylene groups. Mice were injected with peg - mnp at concentrations of 0, 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 m. To retain the water - solubility of pws - mnps for further biomodification, metal ion - chelating , polyethylene glycol ( peg ) chains were introduced to the mnp. The diameter of the peg - functionalized mnp became large and reached 7.0 nm. The peg - modification did not influence the absorption properties of melanin. Rgd is a cyclic arg - gly - asp - d - phe - cys [ c(rgdfc ) ] peptide ( abbreviated as rgd ) which can target tumor v3 integrin. The number of rgd attached to the mnp was calculated to be about about 8 per mnp and the size of the functionalized peg - mnp increased a little to 9.6 nm ( figure s4 ) . in vitro and in vivo study of mri of fe - chelated mnps. Peg - mnp and rgd - peg - mNP showed intriguing photostability ( only 3% reduced absorption ) ( figure s6 ) , indicating their high capability for pai. Further stability assay of fe or cu - chelated mnps in pbs solution showed that only about 3% cu and 7% fe were released at the first 2 h. The photoacoustic signals of peg - mnp increased linearly with the increase of the concentration of the drug. Inveon research workplace ( nexus 128) was able to obtain 3d pa imaging, which provided the more clearly enhanced blood vessel signals in tumor after mnp injection.

The resulting mnps displayed excellent stability in pbs solution ( figure s10) and were suitable for radiolabeling of biomolecules and imaging. The in vivo pet of mnps was performed in u87mg - tumor - bearing mice. cu - rgd - peg - mnp showed tumor accumulation and clear tumor  contrast after 2 h postinjection ( figure 5b ) quantification analysis revealed that the tumor uptake values of cu - Rgd - Peg - MNP gradually increased with time to 24 h. These data indicated the mnp was cleared mainly through the liver. MNP platform for multimodality imaging can efficiently combine its native photoacoustic properties with radioactive and magnetic properties. melanin has been used as an effective molecular target as well as contrast agent for pai because of its strong light absorption properties. We herein developed the functional biomarker , melanin , as a novel nanoplatform with its native optical property and multifunctions.  melanin has intrinsic strong chelating properties to many  metal ions including cu and fe , which can be used to nuclear imaging and mri. melanotic melanomas show hyperintensity on t1-weighted  mri images. Although gd ion has higher t1 mri effect than fe ion , its potential  toxicity is still a problem. Peg encapsulation is found to enhance the biocompatibility and the water - solubility of melanin. Peg encapsulation can also efficiently prevent the formation of metal ion - initiated precipitation. The mnps modified with rgd exhibited the tumor targeting ability to the v3 integrin overexpressed on surface of tumor vasculatures. Pai provides functional and molecular information on the tumor with high spatial resolution. mri provides anatomical information on disease but generally lacks of molecular imaging capability. combination of pet / pai / mri thus allows us to image diseases at different depths with molecular and anatomical information. mnp is of particular interest because such an endogenous agent with native photoacoustic signals with metal ions. olecules for targeted tumor multimodality \\xa0imaging.

       " 'peripheral nerve injuries produce acute pain and often induce neuropathic pain. The hippocampus is a part of the limbic system and has relationships with chronic and acute pain. Acupuncture has been widely applied in china and other asian countries for thousands of years to ameliorate a number of diseases, including acute and chronic pain. The objective of this research is to investigate the effects of ea and the erk signaling pathway on the acute pain - induced responses of pain - related neurons in the hippocampus of wistar rats under both control and neuropathic pain conditions. The rats were fixed on the back and the hair on the neck was shaved. The trachea was exposed by blunt dissection through neck muscles after cutting off the neck skin above the manubrium. All surgical interventions and postoperative animal care were performed in accordance with the guidelines for declaration of the national institutes of health. Intubation was performed using special intubation designed by the laboratory of the institute of acupuncture and moxibustion. The left sciatic nerve was isolated ( the chronic constrictive injured nerve in the cci group ) and covered with liquid paraffin. Local application of antibiotics ( sodium penicillin , 900010000  u / rat ) was used to avoid postoperative infection. Zusanli and yanglingquan are the main points for treating sciatica and other types of leg pain according to the theory of traditional chinese medicine. We analyzed the electrical activities of pain - related neurons whose discharge frequencies increased or decreased by more than 20% after noxious stimuli. The electric activities of 17 pens ( 58.6%) were increased while those of 12 pins ( 41.4%) were decreased.  brief sciatic nerve stimulation significantly increased the electrical activities of 17 hippocampal pens in the control group ( 134.53  18.50% ) and ea group ( 126.1  8.97% ) , and there was no difference between the two groups ( p > 0.05 , figure 1(c) ) . ea reduced the excitatory effects of brief sciatics nerve stimulation on the firing rates of 17 pens. Electric activities of 14 hippocampal pens reached 216.46  25.40% in the cci group and 219.57  44.15% after the noxious stimulus. frequency changes of pins in the ea group were higher ( p < 0.05 ) at 2, 4, and 6  min after giving theNoxious stimuli. Similar to the sham rats, the discharge frequencies of 14 pens were decreased after ea treatment. It is suggested that ea also reduced the excitatory effects of brief nerve stimulation on the firing rate of pens. There was no significant difference between sham and cci rats in the frequency changes at 0, 2, and 4  min. At 6  min after giving the noxious stimuli, the frequencies of pins in the cci group ( 59.82%  9.57 ) were still inhibited. At 10  min, the discharge frequency changes of cci and ea rats showed no significant differences. It is also suggested that ea treatment reduced the effect of brief sciatic nerve stimulation on the frequency of pins.  ea suppressed the excitatory and inhibitory effects of the acute noxious stimulus on the electric activities of pens and pins in both sham and cci rats. Compared with the ea group, the discharge frequency changes of hippocampal pens in the u0126 group ( 195.20  22.98% ) increased significantly ( p < 0.05 ) at 2  min after the noxious stimuli ( after injection of u01 26) No significant differences were found between the U0126 and ea groups at 10  min. combination of u126 + ea produced effects markedly greater than those observed when brief sciatic nerve stimulation was performed alone. k1/2 inhibitor u0126 blocked the ea effect on acute noxious stimulation. The hippocampus is associated with memory , but also with pain and acupuncture analgesia. microinjections of nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs   or 2-ag into the hippocampus induce antinociception.  pain - related neurons were involved in the modulation of ea analgesia. ea stimulation resulted in an inhibiting effect on the electrical activity of pens and an activating effect on pins. after ea at the acupoint  hegu ,  or dolantin given intravenously , gao et al . stimulated the head of the caudate nucleus , eliciting an inhibitory effect on pens and a reduction of inhibition or release of pins. The analgesic effect of ea is related to the electric activities of pain - related neurons in the ca1 area of the spinal cord. ea reduced the effect of acute noxious stimulation on the activities of pens and pins. The electric activities returned to normal level at 6 or 8  min after administration of the noxious stimulus. It is suggested that ea treatment is closely related to severity of pain. The erk signal pathway is probably involved in pain and ea analgesia. It is suggested that involvement of the activation of erk signaling pathway in the hippocampal ca1 region in ea treatment induced pain relief. In cci rats, acute noxious stimulation required a longer time for the firing rate of pain - related neurons to return to normal level.',\n",
       " 'Enterobacteriaceae producing broad - spectrum beta - lactamases belong to the most feared group of bacterial pathogens. esbl and ampc enzymes capable of hydrolyzing broad- spectrum penicillins, monobactams and cephalosporins are clinically very important. The prevalence of esbl in pathogenic bacteria increases the risk of failure of antibiotic therapy, resulting in higher morbidity, mortality and higher treatment costs. Phenotypic and genotypic methods may be used for detection of esbl and ampc enzymes in enterobacteriaceae. The double - disk synergy test (ddst ) , etest or clsi test are used for esbl detection. ampc beta - lactamases may be detected using a modified ampc disk test with disks containing ceftazidime and clavulanic acid. For the isolates, the results of the disk diffusion and microdilution methods and the accuracy of the phoenix automated system were assessed. esbl detection was based on pcr amplification of blatem , blashv and blactx - m genes encoding the most frequent types of these beta - lactamases. ampc beta -\\xa0lactamases were determined by multiplex pcr capable of differentiation of various type of these enzymes.  pcr and direct sequencing were used to detect esbl production in 85 strains and ampc production in 21 strains ( table 2 ) when using the microdilution method with the clsi criteria , the tested strains were shown to be highly false - susceptible to cefoperazone. After the breakpoints for cefepime , cefotaxime and ceftazidime were decreased to 1 mg / l , as recommended by the eucast , the percentage of false susceptibility decreased significantly.  microbiological results of phenotypic tests remain an important primary source for selecting adequate antibiotic therapy and de - escalation antibiotic therapy. detection of broad - spectrum beta - lactamases should be based on specificphenotypic methods. sensitivity of the mddst used for esbl detection was 100% , and 95% in the mampc test. 100% sensitivity in the detection of esbl production is difficult to achieve. The best solution seems to be a combination of 2 phenotypic methods. The ampc disk test with 3-aminophenylboronic acid could be recommended. For basic screening, it would be advisable to use the microdilution method.',\n",
       " \"Migraine is a chronic debilitating neurological condition affecting 1220% of the population worldwide. Only 35% of patients receive adequate preventive therapy. melatonin use in migraine prevention is supported by several biological effects. We aimed to study the effect of melatonin in a double - blind , placebo controlled trial with an active comparator. Patients were recruited from the general population, primary care, advertising and social media. patients / service users / carers / laypeople were not involved in the study design. outcome measures were defined by scientific criteria, designed to better meet patients ' preferences, priorities and experience. results will be disseminated to patients / carer / lay people by publication in the clinicaltrials.org database and to press / social media . Service users / carers / laypeople were not involved in the study design. outcome measures were defined by scientific criteria. results will be disseminated to patients by publication in the clinicaltrials.org database and to press / social media. randomisation was performed centrally with the use of randomisation lists with randomly permuted block lengths stratified according to centre. The study consisted of a 4-week period to established baseline measures followed by a 12-week treatment period. Patients meeting eligibility criteria were randomised 1:1:1 to one of the three groups : placebo , melatonin 3  mg or amitriptyline 25  mg. Patients recorded information about migraine or non - migraine headache occurrence. Primary efficacy outcome measure was frequency in number of migraine headache days per month comparing baseline with the past 4 weeks of treatment. Secondary end points included reduction in migraine intensity, attack duration and number of analgesics used. Adverse events data were summarised for the safety population. 59 participants in each groups were determined to provide 80% power to detect a significant difference in the primary endpoint.  melatonin 3  mg and amitriptyline 25  mg efficiencies were superior to placebo ( p<0.05 ) when comparing baseline with the last month of observation. adverse events occurrence was the most common reason for premature withdrawal for all randomised patients. The primary efficacy end point was frequency in number of migraine headache days per month. melatonin 3  mg and amitriptyline 25  mg efficiencies were superior to placebo ( p<0.05 ) when comparing baseline with the last month of observation. The most common adverse events were daytime sleepiness, dry mouth , epigastralgia , weight gain and constipation.  melatonin and amitriptyline were equally effective for the primary end point. For the secondary end point number of responders ( patients with a higher than 50% improvement in headache frequency ) melatonin was superior to amitripyline and placebo. The most common adverse events were daytime sleepiness , dry mouth , epigastralgia , weight gain and constipation. Patients taking melatonin had on average a weight reduction. A placebo controlled study comparing a different melatonin compound and dose ( extended - release melatonin 2.0  mg , circadin ( neurim pharmaceuticals , tel - aviv , israel ) ) with placebo showed negative results. Several methodological issues including the short trial length ( only 8  weeks ) and low melatonin dosage limit this trial interpretation.  melatonin might have a direct anorexigenic action regulating hypothalamic pro - opiomelanocortin ( pomc ) gene expression. melatonin is as effective as amitriptyline 25  mg in the primary end point , but better than amitripyline in the secondary end point ( 50% responder rate)\",\n",
       " \"The global prevalence of diabetes in 2012 was estimated to be more than 10% among adults. of the diabetic population 95% are of type 2 , and onset is mainly at an adult age ( more than 25 years ) with the highest prevalence in the eastern mediterranean region and the americas. diabetes is the leading cause of renal failure and blindness in advanced countries. In principle, stem cell therapy avoids some of the serious drawbacks of islet transplantation. Patients can donate their own stem cells to be expanded and differentiated in vitro into islet producing cells. The autologous cells can then be injected back into the patient, thus avoiding possibilities and complications of graft rejection. Pancreatic injury seems to have stimulated the stem cells ' ability to secrete insulin and increases their number. Mscs derived from a variety of human adult tissues were utilized in an attempt for their differentiation into insulin producing cells. bone marrow, adipose tissue, umbilical cord or its blood, fibroblasts, endometrium , and liver cells are among several others. Mesenchymal stem cells facilitated engraftment of hematopoietic stem cells across lineage barriers both in mouse models and clinical trials. The high differentiation potential of escs and ipscs clearly surpasses that of adult stem cells. Some authors argued that the presence of insulin in such cells does not indicate intrinsic insulin production. The use of autologous mscs represents an attractive alternative to allogeneic stem cell transplants. The study did not address the molecular mechanism for the marked ability of stem cells collected from type 2 diabetic patients to produce insulin. Genetic manipulations of mSCs may represent an effective strategy to generate large numbers of insulin producing cells. Many differences between mscs and escs should be considered. Mscs are less pluripotent , already more differentiated than escs. Unlike escs, mSCs can be obtained from different sources, like bone marrow, adipose tissue, pancreatic stroma, and human umbilical cord blood. Mscs are remarkably different from escs because of prolonged exposure to hyperglycemia. Studies in transgenic mice showed that stem cells engineered to produce insulin did much more efficiently in hyperglycemic environment. High glucose concentration in the msc culture was considered as a potent inducer for pancreatic islet differentiation. Mscs are capable of inducing graft rejection when transplanted cross allogeneic mhc barriers. Unlike highly tumorigenic undifferentiated escs , the msc administration for the treatment of diabetes seems to be effective even without a predifferentiation protocol. The clinical feasibility of using autologous mscs along with minimum or no immune suppressive regimens improves the outcome substantially. For how long can these cells maintain their active function in vivo ? and what is the optimal site for their transplantation ? information regarding the duration of active function is limited by the observation period following transplantation in experimental models. It is now recognized that it may not provide the optimal microenvironment due to immunologic, anatomic , and physiologic factors that contribute to early loss of the islet mass after its infusion. alternative sites are currently under investigation.\",\n",
       " 'macrophages are endowed with highly dynamic projections of their cell surface. This allows them to move and to survey the extracellular milieu with extensions such as filopodia and lamellipodia. These structures are abundant on macrophages and their distinctive and recognisable morphologies can be appreciated by viewing the macrophage surface using scanning electron microscopy.  dorsal ruffles are veils of membrane that rise up from the dorsal surface of adherent cells or sometimes occur at peripheral edges of cells. They behave in a wave - like manner , rising up and then collapsing back onto the surface. Ruffles share some morphologically and molecular features with other f - actin - rich surface structures , notably podosomes and the invadopodia of cancer cells. Ruffles are highly enriched in phospholipids, which support the charge - based recruitment and attachment of proteins. phosphatidic acid in the pre - ruffle membrane helps to generate f - actin. phosphoinositides also recruit effector proteins to the membrane such as transporter associated with antigen processing 1. The adp - ribosylation factor - like ( arl ) protein , arl13b , has recently been demonstrated in dorsal ruffles. Arl13B is a key component of primary cilia , specialised organelles for mechanosensory regulation and signal transduction. Although macrophages ruffle constitutively, ruffling is enhanced by exposing cells experimentally to lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) of gram - negative bacteria. The collapsing ruffle creates another signalling platform for biasing immune outputs. In addition to tlr4-mediated transcriptional regulation and synthesis of cytokines , the dorsal ruffles and pre - phagosome membranes are also sites for release of cytokine such as tnf. Newly synthesised tnF is delivered to recycling endosomes that feed membrane to the base of the ruffle and pre- phagosomal membranes.  macropinocytosis is the process of fluid gulping practiced at some level by most cells of the body. It is scaled up to a high volume highway in macrophages as they perform surveillance of the surrounding tissue. It results in the ingestion of fluid plus any fluid - phase cargo and a large swathe of plasma membrane. This is reflected in the nature of the macropinosomes themselves, which are uncoated , nondescript vesicles.  actin polymerisation in dorsal ruffles or at the leading edges of motile cells provides the platform of branched actin filaments needed to assemble the macropinosomes. multiple small gtpases contribute to actin regulation during macropinocytosis including the rho , rac , cdc42 , rab , arf and ras subfamilies. The transition of pi(4,5)p2 to pi(3,4, 5)p3 and then topi(3)p is conserved during the processes of macropino closure and maturation.  pi(3,4,5)p3 can then activate phospholipase c and diacylglycerol during macropinosome maturation. accordingly, inhibitors for these enzymes variably block macropinocytosis. macrophages , but interestingly not immature dendritic cells , from snx5 knockout mice have significantly reduced macopinocytic uptake of markers or pathogens. The non - selective nature of macropinocytosis lends itself to exploitation for the delivery of a variety of particles , soluble drugs , genetic material and biological modifying into cells. Recently, the supercharging of macrocytosis in tumour cells by activating epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) and oncogenic ras provided efficient delivery of engineered cytotoxic exosomes. Actin filaments are a feature of only the early stage ruffles , pseudopods and phagocytic cups. Actin polymerisation is activated by different receptors ( through diverse pathways ) and engaged for the f - actin and receptor - mediated protrusion of the membranes over the surface of the prey during engulfment. phospholipid transitions that accompany ruffling and macropinocytosis have also been mapped. The sequential nature of rab recruitment also experimentally defines successive stages of phagocytosis. Some pathogenic bacteria have developed the ability to actively induce phagocytes and macropinosomes to gain entry into the host cell. The highly infectious and deadly ebola virus and mosquito - borne flaviviruses like dengue , west nile , yellow fever and the newly emergent zika viruses all rely on macropinocytotic entry for entry into human cells.  ebola entry into macrophages is calcium dependent relying on the class of endosomal two - pore channels. disrupting the function of these channels either genetically or with pharmacological inhibitors such as tetrandrine can prevent virus infection in human macrophage. vaccinia virus also uses macropinocytosis as a main but possibly not exclusive pathway for entering dendritic cells.',\n",
       " 'otoacoustic emissions ( oaes) are routinely used in the assessment of the functional integrity of the cochlea. The dpoae response can be recorded in 2 modalities : ( i ) by varying the amplitude of the stimulus , keeping the frequency fixed ( input  output or i / o - function protocol ) ; or ( ii ) by fixing the amplitude and varying the frequency ( dp - gram protocol ) The behavior of the i / O function is considered a good index of cochlear nonlinearity. Oaes are 78 times more common in healthy ears than in ears with middle ear complications. Oaes in children with otitis media ( om ) with effusion are helpful in evaluating the middle ear during treatment. om was found to be responsible for 30% of the fail rates of hearing screening. mpanometric curve with values comprised from 0.3 to 2 cc for the middle ear mobility and from 50 to + 50 dapa for the pressure peak. presence of acoustic reflexes at 1000 hz ( evoked by 100 db stimuli ) ; ( iv) dpoae responses with signal / noise ratio ( snr ) at least 3 db spl above the noise floor at the f2 frequencies 2002 , 3174 , 4004 and 6384 hz. exclusion criteria : ( v) alcohol and drug dependence; ( vi) presence of vertigo; ( vii) middle - ear complications in the last 12 month prior to the enrollment to the study. The study design was evaluated and approved by the ethics committee for the analysis of research projects. The medical history of each subject on previous incidents and occasional treatment of om in the last 10 years was assessed by a detailed questionnaire. The subjects were screened by 8 criteria, including a normal audiometric threshold ( 25 db hl) and presence of acoustic reflexes at 1000 hz. Frequencies were tested in this order : 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, 8000, 500 and 250 hz. dpoaes ( dp - grams) were recorded using the ilo 292  usb - ii , v6 ( otodynamics ltd, hatfield , uk) Data were considered valid when the dpoae amplitude was at least 3 db higher than the noise floor level. The dpoae responses from the control group were larger than those from the study group at all frequencies except at 6384 hz. At 1501 hz statistical differences were observed for the stimulus levels from 50 to 30 db spl. At 3174 and 4004 hz all stimulus levels presented significant differences. The mean admittance peaks at 226 hz were 0.47 and 0.69 cc for the control and study groups. This study investigated the variations of dpoae responses in subjects with and without a history of middle ear dysfunction in a time span of 10 years. The main reason for investigating these variations originates from the conclusions of a previous pilot study. The data of this study show that despite the absence of statistical differences between the pure tone audiometry and acoustic immittance measurements , from a dpoaes point of view statistical differences exist between the 2 tested groups. The results corroborate data from previous studies. The slopes of the dpoae i / o functions were shallower ( ie , with smaller values ) than slope values from the control group. The mean group - difference was significant only at 3174hz. The results may be useful to in differentiating between middle and inner ear dysfunction. It remains unclear whether the distinct patterns found in the dpoae i / o functions of the study group were related to cochlear dysfunction. middle ear dysfunctions may produce subclinical alterations undetectable by traditional pure - tone audiometry or immittance audiometry. The fact that the d Poae. slope is not greatly modified suggests that the co chlear non - linearity is preserved after a middle ear dysfunction.',\n",
       " ' beating heart technique without aortic cross - clamping is an acceptable alternative to mitral valve surgery with low operative morbidity and mortality in cases with compromised ventricular functions.

One of the most feared complications of beating heart mitral valve surgery is air embolism. Aortic competence also serves as a secure aortic - clamp and prevents air emblism.

       " \"Dental implant - supported prostheses have become one of the significant treatment modalities for replacement of teeth. Success of dental implants is highly dependent upon the integration between the implant and the intraoral hard / soft tissues. Success is determined by the transmission of occlusal load and resultant stress distribution in the surrounding bone. Finite element analysis is a computerized numerical technique used to determine the stress and displacements through a predetermined model. This study compared the stress distribution pattern of a passive fit and friction fit implant abutment interface in different areas of the implant and bone. The study models were constructed using reverse engineering technique in pro - engineer 05 through three - dimensional ( 3d ) optical scanning and point cloud data extraction. The dimensions of a mandibular premolar are 7.5 mm buccolingually , 9 mm mesiodistally , and 8 mm cervicoocclusally. The 3d models corresponding to the geometric model was meshed using hypermesh 10 and then imported into ansys 13 software to perform the numerical simulation. The implant abutment complex was constructed using reverse - engineering technique. The study models were constructed using reverse engineering technique in pro - engineer 05 through three - dimensional ( 3d ) optical scanning and point cloud data extraction. A distributed force of 100 n was applied onto the top surface of the crown vertically along the long axis and then obliquely at 45 to the longitudinal axis of the implant. The implant abutment complex was constructed using reverse - engineering technique. The 3d models corresponding to the geometric model was meshed using hypermesh 10 and then imported into ansys 13 software to perform the numerical simulation. The data obtained from ansys calculation can be presented in a stress distribution map with a color scale, which makes it possible to compare the stress level in various component structures. Von misses stress ( in mpa ) on the implant abutment complex with prosthesis having narrow , ideal and wider occlusal tables. n on each model in vertical and oblique direction were recorded on a color scale. von misses stress on the bone with friction fit connection and passive fit connection during vertical loading. The study was to analyze the influence of two different types of implant abutment connection on the stress distribution pattern in the implant and the surrounding bone. six models were constructed in pro - engineer 05. The study represent two broad categories of implant Abutment connections currently available in the market. The passive fit or the slip - fit represented by the nobel replace tri - lobe connection and the friction fit or active fit represented\\xa0 by the\\xa0nobel active conical connection. The implant and abutment complex was placed in cortical and cancellous bone modeled using a ct scan. This complex was subjected to a force of 100 n in the axial and oblique direction. The mean values of the overall stresses on the implant and the bone shows that the friction fit connection absorbs more stress and dissipates less stress. The highest stress occurs in the implant 's most cervical region when an occlusal load is applied upon an implant and the load is partially transferred to the bone. This phenomenon is due to one of the principles of engineering , that is , when two materials are in contact with each other , and one of them is loaded , the stresses will be higher at the materials initial point of contact. A 30% to 40% reduction in the occlusal table in a molar region has been suggested. Any dimension larger than the implant diameter can cause cantilever effects and eventual bending moments in single - implant prostheses. A narrow occlused table reduces the chance of offset loading and increases axial loading. This eventually can decrease the bending moment. The maximum von misses stress was seen in the region of the cortical or the crestal bone. A significant reduction in von misses Stress was observed at the boundaries between cortical bone and cancellous bone in both loading conditions. This is because of relatively low elastic modulus of cancellous Bone. The friction fit connection is superior to the passive fit connection. A narrow occlusal table may increase axial loading and decrease nonaxial loading for the implants. This reduces the stress on the implant, implant abutment interface , and bone. It is recommended that the size of the occlusion table to be 30% to 40% smaller for molars.\",\n",
       " \"In the next 30 years, the number of people over 65 in the world will almost double to 1.3 billion. The percentage of those 80 and older will be 31% , while the number was 18% in 1980. For many of those in the fourth age ( 80 + ) issues such as physical illness and approaching mortality decimate their functioning and lead to the need for nursing home care. A recent study reports that the presence of depression has a statistically and clinically significant negative impact on well - being. depression is expected to be the highest ranking cause of disease in the developed world by 2020. Therefore , finding new and alternative approaches to weaken this detrimental development is highly warranted. self - transcendence is found to be such a correlate and a resource for well -Being among vulnerable populations and at the end of life. Self - transcendence has been considered a central aspect of human spirituality. Studies on various populations demonstrate an inverse association between depression and self- transcendence. The authors of this study investigate the associations between interpersonal and intrapersonal self - transcendENCE and depression among cognitively intact nh patients. Interpersonal self - transcendence has negative effect on depression among cognitively intact nh patients. The data were collected in 2008 - 2009 from 250 long - term patients in 44 nhs. The sample consisted of 146 women ( 72.3% ) and 56 men ( 27.7% ) , where the mean age for women was 87.3 years and 82 years for the men. Depression was assessed by the depression subscale of the hospital anxiety and depression scale ( hads) The items were scored on a four - point scale ranging from totally disagree to totally agree. The internal consistence of the construct ( table 1 ) was satisfactory (  = .68 ) . interpersonal and intrapersonal self- transcendence were assessed by items from the self - transcendence scale. Four - point likert - type scale from 1.0 to 4.0 ( not at all ) with higher scores indicating higher st. content validity is adequate, based on a thorough review of empirical and theoretical literature. support for construct validity has been found in the relationships of self - transcendence scores to other measures.  reliability for the latent constructs in this study is further investigated inside the confirmatory factor analysis ( cfa ) . composite reliability ( c ) is reported in table 2 displaying values between 0.65 and 0.75 ; values greater than 0.60 are desirable. A structural equation model ( sem) of the hypothesized relations between depression and self - transcendence was tested by means of lisrel 8.8. All estimates were significant ( p < 0.05 ) and loaded positively and clearly on their intended latent variable. moderate correlations were found between the latent constructs included in the sem model. The alpha levels for the various measures indicate an acceptable level of inter - item consistency in the measures with cronbach 's alpha coefficients of .65 or higher. The aim of this study was to explore the association between interpersonal and intrapersonal self - transcendence and depression in cognitively intact nursing home patients. By 2020, depression will be the highest ranking cause of disease in the developed world. This study provides more specific guidelines to nursing interventions promoting well - being in nh patients. The intrapersonal self - transcendence comprising nh patients ' self - acceptance as growing older, adjusting well to the changes in physical abilities and the present situation related negatively to depression. interventions facilitating nh Patients ' involvement and connectedness , sharing wisdom , and possibilities helping others might decrease and prevent depression. Self - transcendence as an individual developmental process toward personal maturity and a resource for well - being might serve as an indicator of successful aging among nh patients. Some of the intrapersonal self- transcendence indicators loaded low and displayed low r - values. These items involve finding meaning in past experiences, accepting death as a part of life and enjoying one 's pace of life.  depression is one of the most prevalent mental health problems facing european citizens today. The results suggest that the intrapersonal self - transcendence affects depression stronger than the interpersonal self- transcendence among cognitively intact nh patients. This might indicate that facilitating self - acceptance and helping patients adjust well are crucial to decreasing depression. Nurse - patient interactions has been found to be an essential factor of quality of care. Staff nurses might promote self - transcendence and therefore personal maturity , decreased depression , and enhanced well - being. nursing research and education should pay more attention to interventions promoting self- transcendence.\",\n",
       " 'compartment syndrome involves injury to the nerves , vasculature and muscles by raised pressure within the compartment due to muscle injury, fracture , ischemia , or inflammation. crush syndrome is characterized by major shock and renal failure following a skeletal muscle injury. these two syndromes can also result in peripheral nerve injury ( pni ) by direct compressive or traumatic nerve injury. a longer duration of immobilization would seem likely to lead to more severe muscle injury , following a more frequent occurrence of pni in comatose patients following an overdose. We therefore retrospectively investigated the relationship between duration of the com atose state and severity of rhabdomyolysis. The interval of time between drug ingestion , frequency of pressure ulcers and ck levels were all significantly higher in the pni group than the control group. ck level on arrival, duration of hospitalization, frequency of sequelae , and survival rate were all compared between pni and control groups. Two of nine patients who demonstrated sensory disturbances without paresis had symptoms that subsided within three months.  pressure ulcers also develop due to morphological and biochemical changes triggered by the combined effects of mechanical deformation and ischemia that occur during extended periods of immobilization. direct nerve compression or indirect nerve injury due to raised pressure in the body compartment containing the nerve during prolonged immobilization resulted in the development of either paresis or sensory disturbances. immediate fasciotomy is recommended when the compartment pressure exceeds 30 mmhg or when clinical symptoms are overt.',\n",
       " 'There is increasing evidence that gait variability is a quantifiable indicator of walking function. Gait variability has been associated with motor control function, energetic cost of walking, and falls in various populations. Currently, there is no gold standard to quantify gait Variability. Different metrics quantify different aspects of gait\\xa0variability\\xa0on different timescales. Multiple sclerosis ( ms) is a progressive disease in which damage to the central nervous system causes widespread dysfunction. Walking impairment is one of the most commonly reported symptoms of ms. Studies have shown that individuals with ms walk slower and take shorter steps than healthy controls. The purpose of this report is to review the current state of the literature concerning gait variability in people with ms. There have been multiple reports documenting increased variability of kinematic and spatiotemporal gait parameters in individuals with ms compared to healthy controls during walks of up to 10 meters. Data collection using optical motion capture for overground walking is limited by the capture size. Accelerometer - based mobility monitoring has been implemented successfully in persons with ms.  persons with ms demonstrated greater cv of both step time ( cvst = 4.7% ) and step length (cvsl = 5.1% ) compared to healthy controls. variability of step length and step time is greater in individuals with ms with greater disability. The association between disability and gait variability has not been studied. The 6-minute walk test is a common clinical gait test in which gait variability has been characterized in individuals with ms. Individuals with ms who use assistive devices experienced significantly greater increases in variability of step time, length, width , and double - support time in the last 2 minutes of the test compared with the independently ambulatory ms group and controls. The authors suggest that changes in gait. variability could be related to changes in stability and fatigue over the course of the 6- minutes walk test.  persons with ms have greater amounts of gait variability in short and long walking tasks. The mechanisms underlying this change in gait are not clear. It is important to note that the use of a treadmill could potentially change walking behavior, including gait\\xa0 variability. Future work should examine the structure of\\xa0gait variability\\xa0in people with ms in overground walking. . functional muscle strength has been associated with gait variability in healthy older adults. spasticity , the hyperexaggerated stretch reflex , is very common in persons with ms and has been found to be related to gait dysfunction. There is evidence that persons with cerebellar ataxia have greater gait. variability than healthy controls. It is possible that elevated gait variability in persons with ms is related to the amount of energy required to walk. One study on fatigue in ms ( n = 14) showed significant associations between gait. variability and fatigue inms during walks to exhaustion. Gait variability has been associated with falls in other clinical populations such as the elderly. There is limited evidence linking gait variability and falls in ms. Given that 50% of individuals with ms fall in a given year, an association between gait Variability and Falls in ms is clinically relevant. Gait variability could potentially be altered through therapeutic intervention, although specific observations have not been reported. Future interventions in ms should document gaitVariability as a unique indicator of gait function.',\n",

The recent introduction of composite tissue allotransplantation ( cta) can solve several limitations of the conventional treatments. The successful hand transplant was the most important contribution to the introduction of facial transplants. The recent introduction of composite tissue allotransplantation ( cta ) for facial tissue transplantation emerged to solve several limitations of the conventional treatments. cta involves simultaneous transplantation of the skin, muscle, nerves, bones, cartilage and blood vessels. There are several controversies over transplantation between humans involving aspects that form the ethical basis of transplants. The bone morphology of the recipient will give a different look to the transplanted facial tissue. Facial transplants may also affect the patient s autoimmune response that has to be controlled with standard immunosuppressive drugs. Psychological acceptance of the graft by the patient is very complicated and it may be considered as a determining factor for the transplantation success. psychological issues are directly related to the patient s desire, the difficulty of re - insertion in the society, non - verbal communication deficits, anxiety , fear and hypervigilance associated with graft failure. cta has been a feasible treatment after 5 and 13 years of clinical experience. Facial transplants emerged to restore not only the patients aesthetics , but their function , and consequently to promote their re - insertion in the society. The successful hand transplant was the most important contribution to the introduction of facial transplants. The survival rate of transplantation was 100% and the aesthetic and functional aspects have been described as satisfactory. Facial transplantation became a clinical reality for mutilated patients in 2007. The recent introduction of composite tissue allotransplantation ( cta ) for facial tissue transplantation emerged to solve several limitations of the conventional treatments. cta involves simultaneous transplantation of the skin, muscle, nerves, bones, cartilage and blood vessels. The bone morphology of the recipient will give a different look to the transplanted facial tissue. Facial transplants may also affect the patient s autoimmune response. High incidence of infection in facial transplants has been attributed to the high doses of immunosuppressive drugs needed to prevent rejection in the post - surgery acute phase. Clinical success was observed in one of the first cases of cta facial transplant15. Facial transplantation is a feasible option to restore a severely disfigured face when conventional treatment is not able to provide adequate aesthetics and function. Mutilated patients lose their original personality leading to social isolation, unhappiness, depression and stress. Most of the transplant failures are related to the non - compliance of patients with the immunologic treatments.',\n",
       " 'Mfat-1 was introduced into c57bl/6 mice by pronuclear microinjection. rat insulinoma ins-1 cells cultured in rpmi-1640 medium were infected in the presence of 7.5 mmol / l glucose ( no serum) with either a control ( ad - lacz ) or ad - mfat1 virus at a multiplicity of infection ( moi ) of 100 for 4 h. Ins-1 cells or groups of 10 islets of similar size were preincubated in krebs - ringer bicarbonate buffer ( krbb ) and 2.8 mmol / l glucose for 1 h at 37c. The cells or islets were then incubated in 1 ml fresh krBB containing either low glucose (2.8 mol / l ) or high glucose ( 11.1 for ins-1 or 22.2mmol / l for islets ) for 30 min. At the end of incubation, supernatant was collected and the cells were harvested for elisa determination of secreted or cellular insulin content. The cells were treated with rpmi-1640 medium containing with il-1 or tnf- ( 10 ng / ml ) for various lengths of time. Total rna was prepared using trizol reagent ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca ) and reverse transcribed with a superscript kit. The real - time pcrs were carried out on an abi7900 taqman machine with the following cycles : 50c for 2 min , one cycle. Lipids extraction from tissues was performed according to the general technique of bligh and dyer ( 12 ) identification of components was by comparison of retention times with those of authentic standards ( sigma ) All paired comparisons were subject to a two - tailed student t test with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. The coding region of fat-1 cdna was optimized for mammalian cell expression. The resultant cdna , renamed mfat-1 , was synthesized by geneart. Ins-1 cells or groups of 10 islets of similar size were preincubated in krebs - ringer bicarbonate buffer ( krbb ) and 2.8 mmol / l glucose for 1 h at 37c. The cells or islets were then incubated in 1 ml fresh krBB containing either low glucose ( 2. 8 mmol /L ) or high glucose ( 11.1 for ins-1 or 22.2 mmol / L for islets ) for 30 min. At the end of incubation, supernatant was collected and the cells were harvested for elisa determination of secreted or cellular insulin content. Group of six islets of similar size were preincubated in krbb containing 2.8 mmol / l glucose with or without 50 ng / ml pertussis toxin ( ptx ) and 10 mol / l prostaglandin e2 ( pge2 ) for 12 h before the study. ins-1 cells were infected with ad - mfat-1 and ad - lacz for 4 h before being switched to the medium without viral particles. after 48 h the cells were treated with rpmi-1640 medium containing with il-1 ( 5 ng /ml ) or tnf- ( 10 ng /ML) for various lengths of time. analysis of extra cellular signal related kinse 1/2 Lipids extraction from tissues was performed according to the general technique of bligh and dyer ( 12 ) identification of components was by comparison of retention times with those of authentic standards ( sigma ) All paired comparisons were subject to a two - tailed student t test with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Although the newly generated transgenic mouse model is similar to the one reported earlier ( called fat-1 mice  ) ( 13 ) , the codons of Fat-1 cdna are further optimized for efficient translation in mammalian systems. The total percentage of n-3 plus n-6 pufas in mfat-1 transgenic tissues was modestly reduced. This corresponded to a minor percentage increase in some other fatty acid species. Similar observations have been made in previously reported fat-1expressing tissues or cells ( 14,15) Mfat-1 activity in the -cells would also enhance insulin secretion. We used an adenoviral expression vector to introduce m fat-1 into the islets originally isolated from wild - type mice and into a rat insulinoma cell line, ins-1. The cellular levels of n-3 pufas were sharply elevated. The relative fold of stimulation did not differ between the transgenic and wild-type islets. Insulin secretion as a result of cell production of n-3 pufas is beyond the scope of high glucose and glp-1. We tested whether certain types of amino acid  induced insulin secretion could also be elevated in mfat-1 transgenic islets. There was a significant increase of insulin secretion in the m fat-1expressing islets above that in the wild - type islets ( fig . 1d and supplemental fig . 3d ) The broad positive impact on glucose , amino acids , and glP-1induced insulin release observed in such engineered islets was likely due to the modulation of secretory mechanisms. To assess the impact of cellular production of n-3 pufas on the viability of pancreatic islets , we incubated the isolated islets with a mixture of tnf- , il-1 , and ifn- at the concentrations typically applied in previously published studies ( 17 ) Double nuclear staining was applied to the live islets using propidium iodide and hoechst dye for staining dead cells and all the cells. as expected, cytokine treatment for 48 h led to a sharply elevated level of cell death in the wild - type islets ( 58 vs. 9% in the nontreated , fig . 2a and b ) ; however, the islets derived from the mfat-1 We infected ins-1 cells with adenovirus carrying either mfat-1 or lacz genes. We then evaluated the activation of erk1/2 and nf-b , two canonical pathways for il-1 and tnf- , respectively ( 1820) The phosphorylation of ib- was sharply attenuated and even delayed in the m fat-1expressing cells. Such differential cytokine signaling pattern is very likely to have contributed to strong resistance of mfat -1expresses -cells to cytokine - induced cell death. The medium culturing the mfat-1 transgenic islets contained less pge2 than the one culturing wild - type islets. addition of arachidonic acid ( aa , an n-6 pufa ) to the incubation medium increased pge 2 secretion from ins-1 cells. Such an increase was significantly attenuated in m fat-1expressing ins -1 cells ( fig . 4a) Preincubation with pge1 ( 10 mol / l ) for 12 h attenuated glucose - stimulated insulin secretion in the m fat -1 transgen and wild -type islets ( fig. 4c) pretreatment with p ge2 completely neutralized the mFat-1 Pge2 has been well demonstrated as a negative regulator of insulin secretion ( 23,24 ) We have shown that cellular increase of n-3 pufas through transgenic expression of mfat-1 enhances glucose , amino acid , and glp-1stimulated insulin secretion in isolated pancreatic islets. This renders the islets strongly resistant to cytokine - induced cell death. The regulation of pge2 largely contributed to the elevation of insulin secretion in mfat-1expressing islets. modern diets contain excessive n-6 pufas but very low levels of the enzyme cox-2. This suggests that the control of inflammation through reduction of n- 6 pufa can have a beneficial effect on -cell functions. The production of n-3 pufas in the -cells and islets via mfat-1 activity is achieved by using n-6 pufa as the substrates. The eicosanoid products derived from n-4 and n-5 are more potent mediators of inflammation than the similar products derivedfrom n-1 and n2. An imbalanced n-2 to n3 ratio is believed to have contributed to the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders and diabetes. obese diabetic ( nod ) mice can mitigate the development of type 1 diabetes. The phenotypes of the islets infected with mfat-1containing adenovirus bear strong clinical relevance. engineered islets with enhanced insulin secretion and viability are always sought to overcome inflammatory destruction and scarcity of available islets.',\n",
       " 'Low back pain ( lbp) is a great social and economic problem. Currently, there is no precise definition of chronic low back pain. lbp can have a variety of different etiologies. The most significant ethiopathogenetic factors of vertebrogenic dysfunctions cited by richardson et al. include disorders of the deep stabilization systems of the spine. The infinity method is a special rehabilitation method developed at the rehabilitation clinic brandys nad orlici. During the study period, 198 patients were treated and examined using a matscan device. The goal was to confirm the efficacy of our rehabilitation therapy, the infinity method. The infinity method can be applied even in the acute phase when a patient may be suffering from intense pain. It offers extended variability of auto - therapeutic exercises. The therapy includes special exercises and training of breathing. The patients plantar function was evaluated using a graphic method ( computer plantography) which graphically quantifies postural control. A scale of 10 cm in length was divided into ten equally long sections and numbered from 0 on the left side for no pain to 10 on the right side for very severe pain. Data were analyzed using the paired t - test for the parametric tests and wilcoxon signed - rank test to analyze the vas data. All the measured values of the test group of the lbp patients showed statistically significant differences. There were significant differences between pre- and post-rehabilitation treatment in the antero - posterior direction of movement of the cof ( p < 0.001 ) , the area covered ( p = 0.0134698 ) and the variation of cof. The sixth assessed dependent variable was pain which also showed a statistically significant reduction. The results of this study show that the rehabilitation treatment of patients using the  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 infinity method resulted in statistically significant improvements.  rehabilitation therapy is recommended as back pain onset prevention as well as treatment of patients who already suffer from pain. For acute pain , it is also recommended to initiate treatment with non - opioid analgesics or nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs. For restoration of locomotion, it is advisable to choose an individual rehabilitation program which the patient can continue at home after proper training. In the present study lee et al. utilized posturography for the comparison of patients with lbp with a control group of healthy individuals. They mainly found significant differences in a - p excursion of cof between patients and the control group. After three weeks of rehabilitation treatment, all four groups showed significant improvements of 1.08 to 2.01 cm on average on the vas. Study was limited by the fact that the results were partially influenced by co - therapies such as electrotherapy, hydrotherapy , or massages, which the patients received in addition to the rehabilitation therapy. Patients confirmed to us that the method was fun and body reshaping. They reported that they would  continue to exercise after the end of treatment thanks to the large number of exercises which they can perform at home.',\n",

       " \"all mice were bred in the charles river facility and transported to the laboratory on request. male c57bl/6j mice and knockouts for the 2-subunit of nicotinic receptors were used in this study. in total, 95 animals were used for the 3 experimental procedures. All experimental procedures were carried out in accordance with the ethical standard defined by the french centre national de la recherche scientifique and european community guidelines for care of laboratory animals. All procedures were conducted to reduce the number of mice used when possible and to reduce their level of pain and discomfort as much as possible. At 8 d after surgery, male mice were tested in the social interaction paradigm to evaluate the effects of local or global ne depletion on social behavior. mice socially isolated were shown to display a higher motivation for social contact than mice reared in groups. behavioral features of affiliative social behavior , i.e. social contact duration and follow behavior, were measured and compared between c57bl/6 and 2 mice. Social interaction task allows large movements and novelty seeking. back - to - back postures were scored when both mice were looking in opposite directions. follow behaviors were defined by mice moving at a speed > 1.75 cm / s with one mouse behind the other. animals were assessed for 10 min in a light / dark box to evaluate anxiety. A video camera was fixed above the apparatus to record the animal 's behavior for offline analyses. The standard epm test is commonly used to assess anxiety - like behavior in rodents. This task relies on conflict between the innate fear that rodents exhibit toward elevated and open areas vs. natural exploration of novel environments. The maze was a cross - shaped elevated maze with two open arms facing each other and two walled arms. entrances were counted when subjects put both forepaws on an arm or on the platform. Twelve animals of each group ( c57bl/6 and 2) were killed by exposure to a rising concentration of carbon dioxide and cervical dislocation. frozen sections were dissected using a punch from 6 regions of interest. levels of ne, da, and 5-ht and their metabolites ( dopac , 5hiaa , and mhpg ) were determined in the supernatant by reversed - phase. onni 's test . dixon 's q test ( 38 ) was used before any other statistical treatment to objectively detect a single outlier within a group of data. flexible social behaviors are strongly modulated by ne and ach systems. We first investigated the effect of global ne depletion on social behavior in c57bl/6 and 2 mice. We also quantified dominance behavior and aggressiveness. Global depletion of brain ne led to opposite effects in c57bl/6 and 2 mice during social testing. 2 mice exhibited higher dominance scores but a similar low level of aggressiveness. basal levels of ne , da , 5-ht , and ach were increased in 2 mice compared with c57 Bl/6 mice in the pfc.  levels of monoamines and ach in the prl of c57bl/6 ( n=12 ) and 2 mice ( n =12 ) increased in 2 mice compared with c57 Bl/6 mice. Neurochemical analysis revealed that basal levels of Monoamine and Ach were higher in the 2 mice. To determine whether this effect was associated with an increase in monoaminergic fiber density, we measured the density of th , 5-ht , and net fibers in the pfc of c 57 Bl/8 and 2 Mice. The 2 mice showed a significantly lower density of Th, 5ht, and Net fibers compared with the c57Bl/8 mice. By contrast, the 5ht fiber density was reduced in Global ne depletion produced opposite effects in social behavior of 2 and c57bl/6 mice. dominant - like behaviors associated with 2 mice were not affected by prl ne depletion ( p=0.40), but aggressive behavior increased by 6-fold. Ne prl depletion produced a similar effect than that of the global lesion in 2 mice, i.e. a 44% decrease in social interaction. Global effects of ne prl depletion on social interaction in c57bl/6 ( sham treated n=25 ; lesioned n=10 ) and 2 mice. contact duration ( p<0.0001 ; fig . 4 ) and a 36% decrease in the number of follow behaviors ( p=0.007 ; supplemental fig) decreased for 2 mice following the lesion. transitional graphs showed an increased proportion of unchanged behavioral sequences ( black arrows ) in 2 mice as compared with c57 Bl/6 mice. C57bl/6 mice exhibited more rigid social behavior after ne prefrontal depletion. In 2 mice, ne prl depletion favored a recovery of the temporal evolution of contact and follow events, thus reducing significantly rigid behaviors. stop behaviors , which were significantly less frequent in 2 mice than in c57bl /6 mice, were restored after ne lesion.  ne depletion of the pfc restored both immobility ( a ) and back - to - back ( b ) sequences in 2 mice. Both behaviors drastically impaired before lesion in c57bl/6 mice. dominance and aggressiveness were shown to be functionally dissociated. dominance was modulated by the cholinergic nicotinic system and the latter potentiated by prefrontal ne. The prosocial behavior observed in 2 mice is likely due to a hypersalience of external stimuli. by disrupted ne transmission in the prl and by the salience of social stimuli being augmented by prior social isolation ( 24 ) The loci of this effect appears to be the pfc and functional nachrs. In 2 mice , ne depletion did not favor aggressiveness. In c57bl/6 mice, ne - depletion led to a profound increase in aggressive - like behavior. After ne global depletion in c57 Bl/6 mouse, da levels increased in the pfc. This suggests an involvement of da in prosocial behaviors.  hyperdopaminergia was also observed in c57bl/6 mice after ne depletion and is likely to be sufficient to cause the 2-prosocial phenotype in these mice. In the absence of 2*nachrs , there was no change in the basal level of da or 5-ht afterNe depletion. These data are compatible with the notion that the hypervigilant states associated with schizophrenia are associated with an overactivity of brain ne function.\",\n",

The purpose of this paper is to examine the potential for community health worker ( chw ) programs to improve access to breast health resources. We focus on south africa as an example country to assess the feasibility of such a program.  community health workers are members of the communities where they work. They should be answerable to the communities for their activities. The most frequently identified roles of chws are health education , health services provision , and patient navigation and support. Early detection, diagnosis and treatment should be the target areas of a community health program. In many areas, chws are the only source of health services. These services include malaria treatment and antiretroviral medication administration. chws have strengthened the health system by providing services to rural communities. that the communities need to assume ownership for chw programs to work successfully. that such programs work best when the community has a strong investment in the program. Chw programs can be an effective part of improving community health, particularly in limited - resource areas of the world. The capacity to expand to breast cancer appears to be feasible. integrating breast cancer education into existing health education would be vitally important because knowledge is an essential starting place in establishing the need for breast cancer screening.  chws would also provide clinical breast exams ( cbes ) as a form of early detection. mammography is the standard screening for breast cancer in high - income countries. population - based screening is not feasible in many lmcs due to high costs of the required equipment and personnel. A recent study from ethiopia illustrates the inefficient multistep health care journey of many breast cancer patients. convincing arguments exist for integrating several health services within one chw program 's domain. screening for breast and cervical cancer could be fit into regular primary care visits conducted by health workers, such as chws. The longer a chw program is established in a community , the more successful it can become. maintaining chw programs requires the ongoing support of the community, in addition to ongoing resources and training. training for chws has been especially effective in keeping programs productive and useful to their respective communities. Chws should be trusted members of the women 's communities and be able to link them to post - screening care after a positive finding. They should also offer guidance to help women understand their diagnoses and courses of treatment. Patients who work with chws are more likely to adhere to follow - up treatment because they have a better understanding of the health system. The magnitude of lives lost to breast cancer in south africa and throughout low- and middle - income countries is unacceptable and in large part preventable. A key resource in ongoing research and implementation is the breast health global initiative ( bhgi ) which recently opened a learning laboratory in kumasi.\",\n",

Although there are many different dog breeds that segregate white spotting patterns , no genes have been identified that are linked to these phenotypes. 'White spotting ' in mice, rats , dogs and horses is characterized by irregular white patches of skin and hair.  genes responsible for white spotting in mice and horses and for hypopigmentation defects in humans have been identified. To determine if ednrb was responsible for the white spotting pattern of the border collie , a portion of canine cdna was cloned. The amino - acid sequence of canine endothelin b receptor was highly homologous to that of other mammalian endotheli b receptors. White markings are often associated with deafness in dogs, cats, and even humans. The link between white spotting and lack of innervation to the distal colon is the neural crest , from which melanocytes and enteric ganglia are both derived. White spotting may explain why aganglionic megacolon segregates in the boxer breed.

       " \"After infection with cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) , a ubiquitous -herpesvirus , the virus - specific cd8 t cell population is maintained. This phenomenon of gradual increase in cmv - specific CD8 t cells population over time is known as memory inflation. inflationary memory t cells are characterized by an effector memory phenotype in mice, humans , and other primates. Inflationary memory t cells are capable of producing effector cytokines such as ifn- and tnf- , and maintain cytotoxicity. These functional features are contrary to those of the exhausted t cells observed in other chronic persistent viral infections. mhc class i tetramer - positive populations using v8.1 or v 8.2 tcr chain increased in latent murine cmv infection. The inflationary response was triggered through antigen presentation by non - hematopoietic cells in lymph nodes at a latent stage of mcmv infection. Inflationary t cell populations are primarily generated by exposure to antigens in blood circulation. The specific molecular mechanism is still unknown.  cells that are primed early in infection may proliferate and maintain the inflationary t cell population. nave precursor cells and memory cells may contribute to the inflating memory cell population over time. Low dose infection of mcmv severely hampered the accumulation of inflationary memory t cells. The manner of antigen processing and presentation might be also important. Asymptomatic human cmv ( hcmv ) infection is present in most of the human population. hcmV is one of the most important antigens that induce repetitive t cell stimulation. This stimulation is a powerful driving factor of immunosenescence. in the elderly, a majority of h cmv - specific cd8 t cells are cd45ra effector memory cells. ' memory inflation' is a term describing progressive expansion of virus - specific cd8 t cells. The expanded cmv - specific t cell population is extraordinarily large and is more prominent in the elderly. inflationary t cells possess rather similar phenotypic and functional features to those of replicative senescent t cells . Non - human primates may be a more suitable alternative as cmv animal models to understand memory t cell inflation. The mechanism by which inflationary t cells contribute to the pathogenesis of geriatric diseases requires further investigation. to dissect the roles and characteristics of inflationary. t cells induced by hcmv infection. to examine the role of hcmV infection in the development of\\xa0 geriatric\\xa0 diseases.\",\n",
       " 'dementias due to neurodegenerative diseases are frequent in the elderly population. vascular factors contribute to ad pathology and perivascular a amyloid deposits have been observed in both ad and vascular dementia ( vad ) The correct identification of patients with dementia might be hampered by the possible overlap with stroke events. clinical characteristics of patients included in the study 0 not determined , 1 still independent , 2 need of care , 3 high need of Care , 4 exitus. controls  =  patients with depression and other non - neurological diseases. all tests were performed in the neurochemistry laboratory at the department of neurology , university medical school , gttingen. csf was examined for standard parameters such as cell count , proteins and immunoglobulins. Amyloid 140 was detected by elisa ( genetics company , schlieren , switzerland ) . The diagnoses of the patients were based on the following criteria : ad, vad, mci and stroke. The anova test ( levene, bonferroni and tamhane t2 ) and kruskal  wallis test were used to compare the values patients having different forms of neurological diseases. All tests were performed in the neurochemistry laboratory at the department of neurology , university medical school , gttingen. csf was examined for standard parameters such as cell count , proteins and immunoglobulins , and tau , phosphorylated tau and amyloid-142 according to established protocols. The diagnoses of the patients were based on the clinical characteristics of patients. We report similarities in the csf profiles of those with ad and those who underwent lumbar puncture after stroke. Both groups are especially comparable concerning age ( ad arithmetic mean of 70.5 years , stroke 72.6 years ) increased tau and decreased a42 were similar in patients with ad. The highest total - tau levels were found in the stroke group ( arithmetic mean 516  pg / ml , median 468  PG / ml ) Cerebrospinal fluid levels of tau, p - tau , a142 and a140 stratified by disease type. controls : patients with depression * * vad without recent stroke. csf levels across the groups c [ a42 ] csflevels across the group. As a biomarker, p - tau was not useful to distinguish between any of the groups. for a42, there was a significant difference between ad and mci. the lowest levels were observed in stroke patients with an acute and limited brain volume damage. the highest were found in a patient 1  month after a media infarction ( tau 1,300  pg / ml ) The csf analysis offers an excellent opportunity to detect early signs of neuronal degeneration and this has been widely used for ad and other dementia disorders. highest tau levels in patients with large stroke areas and subacute stage. for the distinction between vad and ad , csf proteins were found to be more altered in ad , such as a42 decrease and tau increase. Amyloid - peptide burden and changes in app metabolism are altered at first up to 10  years before clinical symptoms. csf a42 values are supposed to predict disease progression in ad , but can be altered in vad , too. analogies between cognitive decline in patients after stroke with or without cerebrovascular pathologies prior to this can be seen in comparison to amyloid impact in ad. A striking overlap is found in vad and ad , such as hypertension , hyperlipidemia , diabetes mellitus and white matter changes subsequently lead into vad on one hand. Patients with ad showed more often large vessel abnormalities, like carotid artery stenosis.  pathological csf profile which resembles those obtained in neurodegenerative dementia / ad a follow-up examination of the biomarkers after several months might be necessary to exclude underlying dementia. Patients suffering from stroke show distinct alterations of pathological cSF profile , especially an increase of t - tau in differential diagnosis.',\n",
       " 'The genus salvia ( lamiaceae) has about 900 different species. Different parts of the plant are a rich source of different phytochemicals including terpenoids and polyphenols. Salvia officinalis , s. miltiorrhiza, s. plebeia and s. menthaefolia are some species that have been recognized to possess anticancer and anti - proliferative activity on tumor cells. This study was designed to explore the cytotoxic and proapoptotic effect of s. chloroleuca on mcf-7 a human breast cancer cell line. The root ( 100 g) was perculated with methanol ( meoh ) at room temperature. The whole extract was filtered and the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure at 4045c.  partitioning scheme of s. chloroleuca methanol extract is presented in figure 1 ( 16 ) . all of the isolated fractions were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide ( dmso ) and then were subjected to cytotoxic and apoptosis assays. Human breast cancer cells ( mcf-7) were maintained in rpmi-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum , 100 u / ml penicillin and 100 mg / ml streptomycin. 10 mcf-7 cells were seeded in each well of a 96-microwell plate and treated with various concentrations of each fraction of s. chloroleuca. The cell viability was determined by measuring the absorbance at 490 nm using an elisa microplate reader ( awareness , palm city , fl , usa ) The cytotoxicity of methanol extract of. s.chloroleuca and its fractions was expressed as ic50 , which was calculated using graph pad software. The mcf-7 cells were treated with ch2cl2 fraction of s. chloroleuca in different concentrations ( 0 , 12.5 , 50 , 100 and 200 g / ml ) for 48 h. The formation of high molecular weight and oligonucleosomal dna fragments was examined by agarose gel electrophoresis. The dna from treated and untreated cells was extracted as explained below. Methanol extract of s. chloroleuca and n - hexane and ch2cl2 fractions decreased cell viability of cells in a concentration - dependent manner. This toxicity was coupled with morphological changes including decrease in cell volume and rounding of the cells. damaged cells became round and shrunken , while the untreated cells remained normal in size and shape. The mcf-7 cells were treated with different concentration of ch2cl2 solvent fractions of s. chloroleuca ( 0 , 25 , 50 and 100 g / ml ) for 48 h. cells exhibited a sub - g1 peak in flow cytometry histogram compared to untreated control cells ( figure 3a) Another characteristic event of cell apoptosis is the fragmentation of genomic dna into integer multiples of 180 - 200 bp units producing a characteristic ladder on agarose gel electrophoresis.  cells were treated with different concentration of ch2cl2 fraction ( lane 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are 0, 12.5, 25, 50, 100 and 200 g / ml respectively ) for 48 h. isolated dna was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. ch2 Cl2 fraction - induced cell death indicates involvement of an apoptotic process. Methanol extract of s. chloroleuca has a cytotoxic and apoptotic activity on mcf-7 cells. The entire extract of plant is generally a complicated mixture of several compounds that possess variable chemophysical properties. The major plan for extrication of these compounds is based on their chemophysical. properties that can be exploited. Ch2cl2 fraction obtained from s. chloroleuca could be used as a potential apoptosis inducing agent. ladder - like pattern of dna fragmentation into the multiples of 180 bp has been considered as a biochemical hallmark of apoptosis. anti - cancer effect through ros induction has been reported for many naturally occurring compounds including d - limonene. N - hexane and ch2cl2 fractions extract low - polar compounds that are either successfully absorbed through the cell or have cytotoxic activity. This can be explained by the low polarity of the solvents used in these fractions. In conclusion , this study determined an anti - cancer effect of ch2Cl2 fraction obtained from s. chloroleuca mediated by the induction of apoptosis in mcf-7 cells.',\n",
       " 'pectin is a natural polysaccharide present in the cell walls of higher plants. It is commonly used for production of foodstuffs like jams, jellies , and marmalades. The degree of pectin methylation ( dm) is related to setting times of the pectins. ectin methylesterase . released methanol can be quantified by means of gc [ 9 , 10 ] or with alcohol oxidase . when alcohol. oxidase is used , the methanols content can be related to formaldehyde   or hydrogen peroxide concentration. We present here a new automated flow injection - stopped flow method for determination of pectin methyl esters. A commercial preparation of a recombinant aspergillus oryzae pectin methylesterase ( pme ) ( ec 3.1.11 ) was a generous gift from dr. methanol concentration was prepared in deionized water using hm citrus Pectin of 69.5% degree of esterification. The reaction rate is proportional to methanol concentration and it is followed using ocean optics usb 2000 + spectrophotometer. The analyzer is managed by a lab written program developed in labview which provides for data acquisition from the detector and control of the pump and injection valve. A separate program was used for extracting data at 505  nm. Aox activities higher than 1.5  u  ml are used, methanol is consumed within the monitoring time and linearity is lost towards the end of the measurement. Low aox activities result in lower reaction rates. Ph changes of the enzyme working solution in the 6.57.5 range do not have any influence on the reaction rate. 10  s preincubation time was used throughout optimization to shorten development time. A second run time used for allowing the reaction mixture to reach the flow cell ( depicted in figure 1 ) was varied from 3 to 11  s. The analytical signal increases along time , the maximum being observed at 9  s , and then it decreases. The analysis time of the developed method is 7 samples h. analysis time is shorter than in manual method where at least 30 minutes are required for saponification. In kinetic methods of analysis only the initial fraction of the reaction is monitored providing a fast alternative to time - consuming end point methods. In order to increase the analysis rate and decrease the detection limit , the analyzer could be coupled to a more sensitive detection technique.  automated flow method for determination of pectin methyl esters. detection limit down to 1.47  mm was achieved at the analysis rate of 7 samples h. paired t - test has shown no significant difference between results from the developed analyzer and manual offline method. further research should focus on the development of flow analyzer for galacturonic acid content.',\n",
       " 'Parkinson \\'s disease ( pd) is an age - related neurodegenerative disease with progressive loss of dopaminergic ( da ) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta ( snpc) In patients, this depletion of neurons presents clinically with severe motor symptoms including uncontrollable resting tremor, bradikinesia, rigidity and postural imbalance. Currently, the only therapies approved for the treatment of pd and ad are agents that attenuate the symptoms ( symptomatic ) of the disease without disease modifying activity except the anti parkinson drug rasagiline. Recent research has suggested that some drugs used for symptomatic relief in pd may also possess neuroprotective activities. rasagiline is currently only drug that may have a disease modifying activity. polypharmacy is the clinical practice of combining two or more medications in a patient \\'s medication profile to treat one specific disease. Duloxetine ( cymbalta) inhibits both serotonin and norepinepherine uptake in the central nervous system ( cns) We will consider examples of compounds with multi - functional neuroprotective - neurorescue properties that may have promise in the treatment of pd. Some of the compounds discussed were discovered through serendipity while others were the products of active drug design projects. Ladostigil ( tv3326) is an anti - alzheimer ( ad)/anti - pd / antidepressant drug. It has been shown to have antidepressant activity due to its ability to inhibit mao - a in the raphe nucleus, striatum, hippocampus, and hypothalamus. It also attenuates 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine ( mptp ) toxicity in mice. Iron accumulation may contribute to the oxidative stress - induced apoptosis reported in both pd and pd dementia. iron chelators such as desferoxamine , clioquinol and vk-28 have been shown to have neuroprotective activity in animal models of ad and pD. hla20 was identified as a potential lead compound for further studies having selectivity for mao - b with an ic50 value in the region of 110 m. M30 protects against mptp and kainate neurotoxicity in mice by virtue of both its mao inhibitory and iron chelating / radical scavenging properties in these two animal models of neurodegeneration. It has recently been shown to have dopaminergic neurorestorative activity in post treatment with mptP and lactacystin models of pd. M30 reduces levels of cellular holo - app, the -c - terminal fragment ( -ctf ) and levels of amyloidogenic a peptide. m30 also promotes morphological changes , resulting in axonal growth - associated protein-43 ( gap-43 ) , which is implicated in neuronal differentiation. The multifunctional properties of m30 suggest that it may offer extraordinary potential as a drug for the treatment of pd. Caffeine is a non - selective adenosine receptor antagonist. caffeine has been suggested to protect against -amyloid neurotoxicity. acute treatment with caffeine and the a2a receptor antagonist zm241385 was found to reverse age - related olfactory deficits and memory decline in rats. One of the receptors activated by glutamate ( together with its co - agonist glycine ) , the nmda receptor , is a major conduit for the influx of calcium ions into cells under excitotoxic conditions. There is a definitive need to develop drugs that can protect or save neurons after an ischemic incident. No effective treatment has been developed to prevent neuronal cells from dying during stroke conditions. ngp1 - 01 ( 8-benzylamino-8,11-oxapentacycloundecane) is a polycyclic cage amine derived from the reductive amination of benzylamine and cookson \\'s \" bird cage \" diketone. It has been suggested that brain - permeable l - type calcium channel blockers may have a salutary effect on the disease. Its favorable fast on - off binding kinetics gives this compound an improved side effect profile compared with other nmda antagonists. ngp1 - 01 (40 mg / kg) reduced nmda - induced membrane breakdown by 31% ( p<0.01 ) while memantine ( 10 mg /kg) reduced choline release by 40% ( fig ) These results demonstrate that ngp1- 01 simultaneously blocks both major neuronal calcium channels and is brain - permeable after peripheral administration. This dual mechanism of modulating calcium entry into neuronal cells might suggest that ngP1-01 may have utility as a neuroprotective agent in pd , stroke and other neurodegenerative diseases. Natural plant polyphenol flavonoids possess multifunctional activities as iron chelators, radical scavengers, anti - inflammatory agents and neuroprotectants. The major constituent of green tea catechin extract ( -)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate ( egcg) plays a major role in the prevention of neurodegeneration. Rasagiline ( n - propargyl-1r - aminoindan) is an anti - pd drug with selective mao - b inhibitory activity. Its s isomer, tvp-1022, is more than a 1,000 times less potent as an mao inhibitor. propargylamine moiety is responsible for the neuroprotective activity seen in both these compounds. anti - pd / antidepressant drug ( sterling et al . 3 ) is a dual acetylcholine - butyrylcholine- esterase inhibitor. ladostigil has been shown to have antidepressant activity due to its ability to inhibit mao - a in the raphe nucleus, striatum, hippocampus , and hypothalamus. It can also raise brain levels of da , norepinephrine , and serotonin. protective activity in animal models of ad and pd ( zecca et al . , 2004 ) . ( 2005b ) developed neuroprotective compounds with dual iron chelating and mao - b inhibitory activity. These authors combined the antioxidant chelator moiety present in an 8-hydroxyquinoline derivative with the propargylamine moiety found in compounds such as rasagiline and selegiline. The accumulation of iron at sites where neurons degenerate in pd is thought to be a major event that is linked to the neurodegenerative process. The novel non - toxic lipophilic ( and therefore brain - permeable ) iron chelator vk-28 , and its multi - functional derivative , m30, offer potential therapeutic benefits for pd. M30 offers extraordinary potential as a drug for the treatment of pd, especially pd dementia. A dual mechanism that includes inhibition of mao - b as well as adenosine a2a receptor blockade offer a novel therapeutic approach to prevent neuronal cell death. caffeine is under some scrutiny as a potential drug to counteract age - related cognitive decline. Kw-6002 is a potent a2a receptor antagonist ( ki of 2.2 nm ) which is undergoing clinical trials for pd. ( e)-8-(3-chlorostyryl)-caffeine ( csc) has been shown to be neuroprotective in the mptp parkinsonian mouse model. The divalent calcium cation plays an important role in neuronal cell death ( lipton , 1999) There is a definitive need to develop drugs that can protect or save neurons after an ischemic incident. No effective treatment has been developed to prevent neuronal cells from dying during stroke conditions. calcium channel antagonists may be neuroprotective in ischemia by antagonizing the influx of calcium into neuronal cells. The importance of calcium overload during cell death suggests that a dual calcium channel and nmda receptor antagonist might be useful. kinje fibers ( van der schyf et al . , 1986 ) . the structural similarity of ngp1 - 01 to another polycyclic cage amine and nmda receptor antagonist , memantine , led to the evaluation of ngP1 -01 for potential nmda receptors antagonism. Its favorable fast on - off binding kinetics gives this compound an improved side effect profile compared with other nmda antagonists such as mk-801. Cage amines such as ngp1 - 01 can inhibit da re - uptake into nerve terminals. These compounds have been suggested to be more useful in treating motor symptoms in pd. polyphenols are natural products present in beverages such as red wine and tea. The major constituent of green tea catechin extract plays a major role in the prevention of neurodegeneration.  egcg appears to be mediated through multiple pathways, including the participation of the pro - survival pkc and extracellular mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) signaling. structurally important features defining their chelating potential are the 3\\',4\\'-dihydroxyl group in the b ring and the gallate group.',\n",

Patients were recruited from outpatient department of department of rheumaticology at king george 's medical university  universal bcg vaccination started in india in the late 50s and currently all children are vaccinated with bcg. sample size was calculated hypothesizing decreased prevalence of tuberculin sensitivity in patients with ra ( 25% ) as compared to that in general population ( 38% ) Patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) both males and females above 18 years of age were enrolled over a period of 20 months. 300 patients were invited to participate in the study from august 2011 to march 2013. Only 256 patients consented out of which six patients did not turn up for tst reading after 72 hours and were thus excluded. primarily the patients were middle aged ( 47.2  10.9 years ) , females ( 85.2% ) and nonsmokers ( 77.2%) with a mean duration of ra of 80.8  63.7 months. Fifty - one ( 20.4% ) of studied patients were tuberculin positive and 187 ( 74.8% ) were negative. One - third of the world 's population is believed to harbour a latent tuberculosis infection. In antalya district , turkey, among the bcg unvaccinated group tst positivity was found to be none in 57-year, 2% in 1425-year , and 7% in > or = 60-year age groups. False negative tst reactions may be caused by high - dose steroids ( > 15  mg of prednisone or its equivalent given daily for one month or longer) in patients treated with daily corticosteroids, tuberculin negativity was associated with a higher dose. of steroids. In our study , among patients on steroids within last one month , eight patients were on steroids , equivalent to < 15 mg ofprednisolone and none of them was found to be tuberculIn positive. Patients should be screened for ltbi with qft - git or tst prior to initiation of prednisolone therapy. negative qft- git  results should be interpreted with caution in patients treated with any corticosteroid. We are especially concerned for the patients with ra planned for tnf- inhibitor therapy as most of these patients are usually already taking steroids in one form or another.\",\n",

       " 'androgen deprivation therapy ( adt) is often administered to patients with prostate cancer as primary therapy of non - metastatic disease. There still exists a lack of evidence of efficacy and the profile of patients most likely to benefit from intermittent versus continuous therapy. prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer death in men in the usa. In intermittent adt, treatment is discontinued after 69  months of adt or when the prostate - specific antigen ( psa ) reaches its nadir. Adt is resumed when psa rises back to a predetermined higher level. The hormonal recovery that occurs during off - treatment cycles potentially facilitates responsiveness of tumour cells to treatment and theoretically limits toxicity. Online survey was completed online by all recruited physicians over a 1-month period ( september 2012 ) . urologist versus oncologist distribution in the sampling for each country was consistent with practice patterns as determined by research partners at the country level and literature. adt was defined in the online survey for respondents as treatment using gnrh agonists / antagonists or bilateral orchiectomy ( excluding antiandrogenic agents ) continuous adt is specifically defined as gnrh treatment for at least 6  months without having a break for more than 3  months at any point since initial gnrh administration. 19 countries selected for this study represent those with high or increasing incidence of non - metastatic prostate cancer. prevalent use of adt among treating urologists and oncologists , and widespread psa screening. eligible respondents included physicians responsible for treatment decisions in patients with non- metastatic cancer. demographic questions included year of qualification, specialty type, practice size, setting and number of patients with total prostate cancer currently under care. All respondents provided informed consent and were incentivised for their time ( eg, using vouchers and money ) All national laws protecting personal data and guidelines from bodies such as british healthcare business intelligence association ( bhbia) were followed. response rates ranged from 1% to 86% ( averaging 5% overall ) using email , fax ( australia ) and telephone invitations. Survey respondents estimated that 99  177 patients with prostate cancer were under their care. 38% ( 28  840 ) received adt : 36% ( 27  653 ) received gnrh agents , and 1.6% ( 1187 ) underwent bilateral orchiectomy. 54% were treated continuously ( 6  months without > 3-month interruption ) , 23% for less than 6 months , and 23% were managed with intermittent adt.  adt , androgen deprivation therapy ; gnrh , gonadotropin - releasing hormone. orchiectomy procedure . nordics : denmark, finland, norway , sweden ; eu5 : france, germany, italy, spain , uk ; eastern europe : czech republic, hungary, poland.

The international survey provides a detailed understanding of how adt is prescribed among patients with non - metastatic prostate cancer. 441 treating physicians from 19 countries indicated that adt was prescribed for 38% ( range 2568% ) of their patients. There were no differences observed with respect to physician characteristics or behaviours such as frequency of psa testing. The use of adt differed by region, with highest rates reported in eastern europe. Among patients receiving gnrh agonists, roughly a quarter were prescribed intermittent adt. Adt use differed by physician specialty, with higher use among oncologists who may see men with higher risk disease. adt is often administered for 6  months or longer , on a continuous basis. Only us practitioners reported using adt for this duration in less than 70% of their patients. Adt has been associated with fewer side effects and increased health - related quality of life indicators in a number of clinical trials. There is growing evidence to support intermittent adt as effective as continuous adt in specific cohorts of patients. This international survey of 441 treating physicians from 19 countries furthers our understanding of how men with non - metastatic prostate cancer are treated with adt. Although we achieved an adequate ( for physician - level research ) response rate of 12% , we acknowledge that treating physicians who completed the survey may differ from non - respondents.

       " ' histone variants are non - allelic isoforms of the canonical histones that can be assembled into nucleosomes in their place. They are thought thereby to provide the basis for regulation of biological processes that require local access to dna. histone h2a has one of the largest variant families , and includes h 2a.z , a protein that is highly conserved across eukaryotes but differs considerably from the major h2 a in each species. The major route for h2a.z into chromatin is via swr1 , the snf2-family atpase at the catalytic center of the swr chromatin remodeling complex. It is still unknown whether the effect of any of these modifications is direct ( such as steric hindrance or charge modulation influencing the formation of higher - order structures ) or indirect. H2a.z in a nucleosome facilitates intramolecular folding to higher - order arrays. It has been linked to both transcriptional activation and repression at various genes. consensus seems to be building towards a role in marking and/or poising promoters for expression. H2a.z mediates a heterochromatin - euchromatin boundary function in budding yeast. Recent mass spectrometry analyses of chicken erythrocytes identified two forms of h2 a.z that differ by just three amino acids. Both isoforms are incorporated into chromatin and both seem to be acetylated on the same three lysine residues within the amino terminus. Plants also have multiple h2a.z isoforms. Three have been reported in a. thaliana - hta8 , hta9 and hta11 - which share about 90% identity but have distinct expression patterns. pie1 ( the plant homolog of swr1 ) interacts with all three variants , but not with h2 a.z-2.',\n",
       " 'This study seeks to explore more of the european activities both within and outside europe. It aims to achieve a more dynamic perspective by asking when , how and why the initial optimism was fuelled or frustrated in the course of the projects. Unlike most studies on white protagonists in africa after independence , this paper has not chosen a recent colonial power with many continuing ties to african countries. Africa became the main regional focus of west german  technical and personnel aid in health. at a total of 130 million deutschmarks for 176 projects. The german togolese relationship in microbiology within the framework of  development aid in the 1960s and 1970s was chosen as an example for closer study. This article looks at practices such as scientific research and training with their core material means of biological samples and publications. It was possible to gain an instructive insight into the different goals , concepts and strategies of these unequal partners by contrasting sources from academia and government. As these different functional systems and sets of practices often exist side by side within the same projects , institutions and persons , their interaction can be studied in multiple ways. Germany occupies a somewhat exceptional place in the history of the interaction between medical academia and health politics at an international level. The decline of smallpox , tuberculosis and other infectious diseases in germany freed up capacity for support of anti - infectious hygiene and vaccination initiatives outside europe. The first west german university institutes and hospitals started their engagement in asia, africa and latin america in the early 1960s. The first so - called entwicklungshelfer [ development aid workers ] did not leave germany until 1964. In the period up to october 1965 , just ten of these members of staff held a university degree. The west german government systemically prioritised aid to individual states as this offered better opportunities for pursuing its interests in foreign politics. within health , it especially supported medical education , training and research. typically, health projects for research and practice were negotiated and operated between two governments. The who itself had to refrain from establishing its own research institutes.  hygiene and public health were regarded by experts as most important for solving the health problems of  developing countries. hygiene institutes in addition to medical education and teaching hospitals became a major focus of early west german development aid. there are several examples of this kind of co - operation with areas of focus quite characteristic of the respective countries.  co - operation in science and higher education became an official part of west german in 1971. projects linking the german government focus on public health to german academia was already in place in the small west african state of togo. german medical relations with togo had already had a long tradition before the country became independent of France in 1960. After independence in 1960 , the new republic of togo and the frg signed a bilateral agreement , which also included health. The first prime minister and subsequent president of to go was especially interested in these relations with the first colonial power. The absence of an institut pasteur , however , was probably a more important actual reason than mere colonial nostalgia or anti - french sentiment. In 1960, heinz peter rudolf seeliger ( 192097 ) was commissioned with a consultancy on the health situation in togo. He visited togo for two months in 1961 and wrote a survey in close collaboration with international agencies such as the who. This then served as the basis for planning the agreed institute of hygiene. The institute was a joint german  togolese enterprise and obviously functioned smoothly , apart from very rare german complaints such as in 1969. The first german team consisted of two doctors, two medico - technical assistants, a mechanic and an electro - technician ; a typist was later added. Herrlich had been an outspoken opponent of the establishment of permanent outposts of european institutes of tropical medicine in former colonial territories. He had considered these places as mainly suitable for training academic novices and not for long - term research. after herrlich s death in 1970 , the parasitologist professor dr gerhard piekarski ( 191092 ) from bonn university replaced him as mentor. The national institute seems to have worked well from the very beginning as a laboratory , vaccination service and advisory body. Its actual functioning in these different areas needs to be looked at in more detail since the whole project was still far ahead of the general development of medical infrastructure in togo. Its main aim was thus specific capacity - building rather than the production of scientific knowledge. Only a few togolese medical students have returned home after completing their education , and they were immediately charged with medical care. as late as 1972, the german project leaders still complained about the lack of  academic staff in the country. The number of togols doctors had nearly doubled since the start of the project. The foundation of a university at lom in 1970 included a medical school.  institutes of hygiene had always been characterised by their combination of research and public health. It remained unclear as to how far this double function was now also intended for the national institute in lom. The chances for the two fields were judged quite differently. In his expert opinion on the institute of 1967 , seeliger stated bluntly:  a research activity of its own can not be considered. The institute took over the tasks of a laboratory for the public health service. The scientists explicitly emphasised research work as an equal task. The only official function in the view of the german donor and the republic of togo was public health. This diversity of aims did not hinder the work of the institute. To date, it has only been possible to identify three articles by the german researchers where a co - author has an obviously african surname. One of these two co - authors was not even a staff member at the institute , but was instead in the service des contagieux, centre hospitalier universitaire , lom ( togo) In the archival documents and apart from the occasional acknowledgement of  technical assistance in the publications , it usually remains unclear as to how far the togolese counterparts were actually involved in the research. There is just one very elaborate acknowledgment from 1976 and 1977 by bockemhl in the context of his research on salmonella and shigella, conducted between 1971 and 1973. The hygiene institute in lom was handed over to the authorities of togo in early 1976 after a year under the responsibility of a togolese director advised by his german predecessor. There was no evidence of conflicts during the transition of power such as those which again paralysed the previously mentioned institut pasteur in cameroon between 1974 and 1980. Togo profited from at least some of the data gathered by german scientists during research. academic publications were often a side - effect of routine activities at the national institute such as health examinations of prostitutes and hygiene checks of schools , wells and food. emphasis was placed on the importance of unbiased , critical parasitological examinations , as opposed to simple routine diagnostics for expected findings. eter meyer - dohm ( * 1930) demanded that the common  transfer of knowledge must be supplemented or even replaced by independent academic colonialism. The project was ill - suited for capacity - building in scientific research. The site for future research was moved from the capital to the regional hospital of sokod. The close relations between germany and togo influenced issues not related to the african continent and development co - operation. The political administration invited academia to play a role in what were both old and new fields. There appeared to be a necessary connection between the progress and modernity that  development aid claimed to bring and the promises of science. The first was directed towards what were regarded as the most backward regions and the latter strived to be at the most advanced edge of human progress. The first task of academics was consultancy to the west german government. The government agencies for technical aid did not yet have relevant experts of their own in these early years. These experts travelled to the tropics in order to identify health problems that would need special academic expertise in the relevant country. Long - standing co - operation which continued after the end of the development project was the decisive condition for building up research capacities. This was fulfilled for routine activities through collaboration between the german and togolese counterparts. Since the 1970s, these relations received regular attention and financial support in both the academic and development sectors. New international health policies of the late 1970s directed towards primary health care. Financial co - operation had their own health experts and professional external consultants. At the 31st g8 summit in gleneagles in 2005, co- operation with africa was declared a task for all ministries.',\n",

It may represent either an extension from primary pleural tumor or occur primarily , derived from the mediastinal ( including thymic ) stroma. Since population - based incidence is not available , it may be safe to infer that the tumor is rare. The close congener of this tumor is the atypical fibroxanthoma found in the skin. It is advisable to check for specific markers and if these are negative , only then arrive at this diagnosis. nosis ; death within a few months of diagnosis was the consequence in many cases.

       " \"Insulator elements are proposed to play a key role as domain gate - keepers. How insulators function is still unclear but they have been proposed to associate together to form chromosomal loops providing a physical basis for chromosomal domains. Recent results in drosophila emphasising links between insulators and the regulation of transcription have once again brought it into focus.  beaf 32a and b were initially identified as factors binding to an insulator element ( scs ' ) associated with the 87a hsp70 heat shock locus. insulator activity is dependent on beaf binding sites and beaf is involved in the formation of a chromosomal loop through interaction with zw5 bound to a second element. Fab7 and fab8 insulators can form loops that bring them into contact with promoter regions of the abd - b hox gene. This configuration is associated with repression of abd- b transcription. In support of the generality of interaction between insulators and the regulation of transcription elongation, jiang et al. found considerable overlap between beaf and nelf binding sites.\",\n",
       " \"alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly. It is characterized by neuronal cell loss and progressive accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles ( nft ) in neurons. The amyloid beta peptide ( a - beta) is the major component of amylid plaques in the brain of individuals affected by ad.  insulin can protect cultured rat neurons against a - beta induced toxicity. A - beta oligomers are more toxic than larger and highly structured fibrils. insulin inhibits its fibrillar growth as shown in a cell - free assay and in the cell surface of human brain pericytes reducing the a- beta toxic effect.  cells were maintained in humidified 5% co2 atmosphere at 37c. recombinant a42 ( ra42) was dissolved in 0.01  m trishcl buffer at ph 7.2   and insulin ( sigma ) in hepes buffer atph 8.2 . cells were treated with two different concentrations 25 and 40  m of oligomeric ra42   for 1 h. after this treatment ra42 was removed and the cell were incubated without or with insulin at different concentrations ( 50 , 100 , 200  m ) for 20 h. in caspase assays , the incubation time with insulin was 4 h. Nuclear morphology and mitochondrial activity were analyzed by microscopic inspection using a leica dhl fluorescent microscope. caspase-8 , -9 , and -3 activities in cells were measured using commercially available luminescent assays. as a first step to evaluate the amount of insulin necessary to interfere with cell damage induced by a - beta oligomers , a dose - response study was performed. Cells treated with ra42 showed a mortality of about 60% and 85% if compared to the control. When insulin was added, a recovery of cell viability of about 20% for the minor concentration and 100%  for the higher concentration was observed. This suggests that insulin plays a protective effect against a - beta toxicity. A - beta oligomers activate caspase 9 and this activation is noticeably reduced by the presence of insulin. The nucleus integrity was visualized by staining the samples with the specific hoechst dye. This analysis confirms that the ra42 induced degeneration via mitochondrial damage has been counteracted by insulin addition.  insulin enhanced a - beta mediated activation of hsp70 suggesting that this major induction could be necessary to complete a cell survival program. We found that insulin inhibits a-beta cell death in lan5 neuroblastoma cells in a dose - dependent manner. insulin can protect cells against damage induced by a- beta oligomers avoiding the apoptosis program.  insulin is able to recover an intracellular damage induced by a - beta , whose effect is to produce cellular stress and degeneration. insulin prevents mitochondrial dysfunction probably by inhibition of ros formation and activating specific cell signaling. insulin activates the serine - threonine kinase akt , a protein downstream of pi3k involved in survival pathway. Akt has been well demonstrated to phosphorylating and increasing the expression of a number of proteins involved in apoptotic signaling cascade such as the bcl-2 family. presence of a - beta produces a toxic effect responsible for the observed neuron death. We show that a stress response is activated by the increased expression of inducible hsp70. insulin may constitute a therapeutic agent against ad activating cell survival signaling pathways.\",\n",

Administration of intraperitoneal tunicamycin did not induce intestinal er stress at 6 hours. Acute exposure to er stress suppressed hepatic tnf , il1 , and il6 expression. These data indicate that suppression of bile acid synthesis by er stress is independent of inflammatory cytokine activation. inhibition of jnk signaling in hepg2 cells did not prevent suppression of cyp7a1 by tunicamycin ( figure  2c ) . fgf15/19-mediated suppression of Cyp7 a1 expression is dependent on erk activation.  induction of er stress suppresses the primary bile acid synthetic pathway and enhances expression of transporters responsible for the removal of bile acids from the liver. Unlike acute er stress, prolonged er stress suppressed hepatic expression of abcb11 and ntcp. We found that prolonged er Stress resulted in induction of the inflammatory cytokines il1 and il6 , suggesting activation of a more generalized hepatic inflammatory response.  cyp7a1 is the primary bile acid synthetic enzyme controlling the rate - limiting step in the conversion of hepatic cholesterol to bile acids. To determine the effect of er stress on hepatic cyp 7a1 expression, mice were treated with tunicamycin ( 0.5 mg / kg ip ) Mice treated with er stress showed robust hepatic upr activation at 6 hours.

Acute exposure to er stress suppressed hepatic tnf , il1 , and il6 expression. These data indicate that suppression of bile acid synthesis by er stress is independent of inflammatory cytokine activation. inhibition of jnk signaling in hepg2 cells did not prevent suppression of cyp7a1 by tunicamycin. The multidrug resistance - associated protein 3 ( abcc3) is a basolateral bile acid efflux pump that is thought to have a protective role in the setting of cholestasis. induction of er stress with tunicamycin, thapsigargin , or homocysteine in hepg2 cells increased expression of abcb11 and abcc2. Unlike acute er stress, prolonged er stress suppressed hepatic expression of ntcp, bile Acid transporters known to be suppressed by hepatic inflammation. prolonged er Stress resulted in induction of the inflammatory cytokines il1 and il6 , suggesting activation of a more generalized hepatic inflammatory response.  er stress showed a mild increase in plasma alanine aminotransferase level ( figure  4f ) and early ballooning degeneration on h&e - stained liver sections. prolonged er stress also resulted in induction of the intestinal upr , suggesting activation of a broader systemic stress response over time. The ire1 pathway is the most evolutionarily conserved branch of the upr and is considered the major mediator of the adaptive response to cellular stress. impaired bile acid metabolism has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetes and obesity , both of which are associated with er stress. The present work implicates er stress as a novel regulator of the major bile acids synthetic pathway.\",\n",
       " 'the snf2 protein was originally identified as a result of genetic screens for genes involved in regulating mating type switching ( swi ) and sucrose fermentation ( sucrose non - fermenting) It was subsequently found to be the catalytic subunit of the multi - subunit swi / snf complex that acts to alter chromatin structure. The rapid progress of genome sequencing has revealed a significant breadth and diversity within the snF2 family.  snf2 family proteins are ubiquitous in eukaryotes. They are also found in a significant number of sequenced prokaryotic and archaeal genomes. Some snf1p and rad54p can be purified from yeast and show function without additional proteins. This suggests that in many cases the additional proteins of the large remodeller complexes may function to enhance specificity or targeting. Eukaryotic snf2 family members have functions which do not seem to be directly linked to chromatin. Despite the diversity of biochemical activity , the presence of the conserved snf1 family atpase domain engine suggests that shared mechanistic features may underlie the way by which these proteins act. A great deal of progress has recently been made in understanding the mechanism of dna translocation and unwinding by dexx box helicases. Structures have been obtained for the sf1 helicase bacillus stearothermophilus pcra in complex with a 3-tail partial duplex dna. These structures revealed an underlying common structural fold and a modular structural organization. Two dna - binding sites alternate in high affinity for dna and move the enzyme along the dna in a process that resembles the movement of an inchworm. during translocation , atp - driven conformational changes between the two reca - like domains result in a closure of the cleft between them. The fold similarity suggests that sf2 helicases might in principle function in an analogous way. The sf2 helicases bind ssdna predominantly by recognition of the dna phosphate backbone. For high affinity sSDna - binding, the sf3 helicase has a specialized domain that is attached to domain 1. The sf1 helicase recg lacks the ssdNA - binding domain of ns3 and translocates double - strand dna. Snf2 family atpases and dexx box helicases possess a related atp - hydrolysis mechanism. The orientation of the second reca - like domain with respect to the first differs by 180 between the crystal structures. The recently determined structure of trcf also has a sf2 helicase - like region related to recg. The structure of the sso1653 region was determined bound to duplex dna and provides a first detailed structural insight into how the snf2 family atpase domain interacts with dna. The total footprint of both phosphate chains amounts to about 67 nt , comparable with footprint of ssdna bound to helicases. The lack of either type of duplex - destabilizing region in snf1 helicases parallels the lack of helicase activity. Dna binds to the sso1653 snf2 family structure along a similar surface path to both sf1 and sf2 helicases ( 43,51,52) The 35 strand of the dna duplex bound to the structure overlays very well with the 35 oligo(du) strand. It is likely that atp - driven opening and closing of the cleft between the reca - like domains transports the 35 strand in helicases. All chromatin remodelling complexes have a snf2 family polypeptide at their core. The action of different complexes can result in nucleosome sliding in cis, histone transfer in trans and histone variant exchange. Support for the idea that complexes use atp - dependent translocation on duplex dna to generate force comes from recent single molecule biophysical analysis of the rsc complex. Transient or non - processive alterations may be sufficient to cause persistent changes to chromatin structure. Mot1p has no detectable dna translocase activity , but disrupts tbp  dna complexes. The csb protein has been observed to wrap dna around itself in an atp - dependent reaction. We need to understand how dna tracking by the translocase domains generates the diverse range of macromolecular changes in substrate dna  protein complexes during the course of remodelling reactions. The role of the helical domains of snf2 family enzymes is not as well understood , but they could play a role in advancing the enzyme by atp - driven conformational changes. Both enzyme families contain a conserved reca - like domain core. helicases transport product ssdna and often contain an upstream dna unwinding element. in contrast, snf2 family enzymes also recognize the 53 strand and track along the minor groove. despite many functional differences , however , both enzymes families bind the 35 strands at an equivalent site.',\n",

In groups 13, moist cotton pellets were placed over the repair materials and sealed with cavit - g. The access openings of all experimental teeth were sealed with light cured composite resin. All teeth were painted with nail varnish, immersed in 2% methylene blue dye for 2 weeks at room temperature. Methylene blue dye was used to evaluate microleakage because it is a simple and an inexpensive technique and has displayed better penetration results than eosin or the radioisotope tracers. teeth with furcation perforations repaired with mta alone showed significantly lesser dye leakage than teeth repaired with other materials. mta has inherent superior sealing ability as demonstrated in several studies. Internal matrix significantly decreased the sealing ability of mta. This could be due to the debris of internal matrix remaining on the walls of the perforation. matrix material fills voids and therefore does not allow mta to enter into these voids. mta shows mechanical bonding and is hydrophilic , easily adapted to cavity walls. Mta showed significantly less leakage than lc gic when used with and without an internal matrix. for ha - based material . the inferior sealing ability of repair materials over ha could be because it is granular , difficult to manipulate , has poor adaptability to the walls and does not set.\",\n",

There were no significant differences in these valuables between the two groups. apan associated with their slimming desire [ 4 , 6 ] . in particular, young japanese women s strong desire to be thin has been pointed out as the underlying cause. The median range of the two recommended weight gains by the jmhlw and iom guidelines may be suitable for the underweight and normal - weight japans during pregnancy. The optimal weight gain recommended by the iom guideline seemed to be more suitable for the overweight japanese women at least during pregnancy. for obese women for preventing dystocia [ 4 , 9 ] ; however , the pre - pregnancy obesity itself might affect the perinatal outcomes more than the range of weight gain during pregnancy as previously reported [ 1 , 2 ]',\n",
       " 'more than 2 billion people globally are estimated to suffer from micronutrient deficiencies. Factors that contribute to poor micronsutrient intake and absorption include poor dietary diversity, poor nutrient density of staplebased complementary foods, antinutritional factors in plantbased foods and environmental enteropathy. strategies such as targeted supplementation with vitamin a , or universal salt iodization are often part of national strategies. xposure of individuals at the high end of the intake distribution curves ( european food safety authority ( efsa 2010 ) . this may pose particular challenges regarding micronutrient interventions that exert benefits in the target population but unintentionally adverse effects in a subgroup of this target population with already high intake or status of the micronUTrient ( e.g. targeted vitamin a supplementation) For some micronutrients, no evidence of risk of adverse effects is established. No safe tolerable upper intake level ( ul) is defined for some microns. Programs should be cautiously designed and monitored to ensure  at risk population groups are reached without any appreciable risk. Dietary intake data can be used in software modelling to predict the shift in micronutrient adequacy in different population groups for a selected food vehicle and fortification level. In risk  benefit approaches , the same principle is used to assess both the preventable burden of disease and the risks related to excessive food or nutrient intake.  complex interactions may exist between the delivered micronutrients and infections and medication use. The benefits and risks of somemicronutrient therefore depend on the setting in which they are provided. There is a need to understand how specific micronsutrients, mainly as folic acid and iron , may interact with medication and infection.  monitoring of data ( dietary intake, program coverage, biomarkers and morbidity ) among vulnerable population groups is essential to optimize effectiveness. Research is needed to identify biomarkers predictive of micronutrient exposure and status. This may help setting the appropriate noobservedadverseeffect or lowestadver seeffect level, particularly for young children.  micronutrients do not necessarily provide benefits in all deficiency conditions. Complex interactions may exist between the delivered microns and infections and medication use. It is encouraging that in many countries the collection of nutrition data is increasing. This will further help program planners and policymakers to design costeffective and safemicronutrient interventions. There is a need to understand how specific micronutrients, mainly as folic acid and iron , may interact with medication and infection. monitoring of data ( dietary intake , program coverage , biomarkers and morbidity ) among vulnerable population groups is essential to optimize effectiveness. The aim of the session was to identify existing tools and needs to assist policy makers in designing effective micronutrient programs with the highest public health benefits and least risks. The presentations in the session addressed this challenge based on a number of case studies related to folic acid , iodine and vitamin a.  increase in micronutrient intake in terms of dalys gained ( world health organization ( who ) 2015 ) . this requires ( 1) dietary intake data in different population groups and ( 2) evidence for a dose response relationship between micronUTrient intake and morbidity because of deficiency. simulating changes in dalys resulting from micronuts intervention programs can provide useful information to policy makers to set investment priorities. Folic acid provided at supraphysiological , and possibly even physiological , levels may favour the growth of the parasite plasmodium falciparum ( responsible for 85% of malaria cases) Folic acid may inhibit clearance of parasite by sulphadoxinepyrimethamine ( sp)treated malaria and increase subsequent recrudescence. The use of 5methyltetrahydrofolic acid concomitantly with sp may be a promising alternative, as it does not affect sp efficacy. Vitamin a supplementation and fortification programs can be a cheap and effective way to reduce morbidity and mortality because of vitamin a deficiency. longterm excessive vitamin a intakes can lead to adverse effects, such as hepatotoxicity. lack of coordination of multiple vitamin a interventions and many overlapping schemes in some areas has increased concern about the risks of these programs. the appropriate noobservedadverseeffect level or the lowestobservedAdver seeffect level for children up to 5 years of age needs to be urgently determined. Dietary modelling can be used to predict the effect of fortification of different food vehicles and overlapping micronutrient programs on the percentage of the population with intakes below ear or above the ul. The role of complementary modelling tools was discussed, including the ( 1 ) lives saved tool ( list ) and ( 2) models assessing liver vitamin a concentration. There is still need for standardized, userfriendly tools which predict the public health impact made by micronsutrient interventions. Research is needed to assess the minimum and maximum intake range for vitamin a outside which intakes might cause concern. In general , the small risks of micronutrient excess are far outweighed by the substantial benefits of overcoming the deficiency. There is an urgent need to monitor overlapping micronsutrient supplementation and fortification programs.',\n",
       " \"several small - molecule inhibitors of the pi3k - mtor pathway have entered preclinical and clinical development as anticancer therapeutics. These inhibitors, including rapamycin and its analogs, have shown promising rationale for their use in cancer therapy. However, clinical responses to these drugs in the absence of patient stratification are generally unpredictable and patients often develop drug resistance. Mtor inhibitors are thought to be related to deregulation of critical upstream components of the pi3k - mtor pathway. Her2 amplification and pik3ca activating mutations lead to elevated levels of phosphorylated akt in many human cancers and have been identified in preclinical models as putative predictors of rapalog response. uate rapamycin response . a role of myc in mediating resistance to pi3k - mtor inhibitors has also been reported in other models. combination therapies targeting both pi3K and myc may be necessary to overcome resistance topi3k- targeted therapy. Rapamycin resistance is often linked to its context - dependent negative feedback loops. Dual inhibitors of pi3k and mtor activity have been developed. These agents have shown greater anticancer efficacy compared with analogs of rapamycin ( rapalogs ) However, the clinical therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of dual pi3K - mtor inhibitors remain to be examined. Mtor inhibition by rapamycin can also induce myc phosphorylation and accumulation in colorectal cancer cells. This suggests that mtor inhibition may trigger a separate compensatory mechanism involving pdk1-myc but not pi3k - akt.  pi3k - mtor inhibitors such as rapamycin , bez235 , and gdc0941 induce either pi3K - dependent or myc - dependent mechanisms, leading to acquired resistance to targeted therapy in cancer cells. combination therapies targeting bothpi3k and myc may be necessary to overcome resistance to pi3 k - targeted therapy. The myc oncoprotein is involved in many critical processes in malignant cells. Myc induction following pi3k - mtor inhibition may be a serious problem in the clinic. To overcome the resistance of mtor inhibitors in targeted therapy, preclinical trials based on xenograft animal studies should be carried out. Targeting myc signaling in cancer therapy is the focus of a new study. The study was published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. It looked at the role of the protein myc in the development of various types of cancer. It also looked at ways to target the protein's signaling system.\",\n",
       " \"assisted reproductive techniques ( art) have enabled many childless couples to achieve their dream of having a child of their own. The number of women undergoing art treatment has increased tremendously over the past three decades leading to more than 5 million children conceived by this treatment. As art traditionally involved ovarian stimulation and replacement of more than one embryo , it had contributed to a significantly higher number of multiple births. The rate of single embryo transfer was about 20% in europe in 2005 , but much higher rates are reported in some countries ( 69% in sweden in 2005 and 57% in australia and new zealand in 2006 ) although set prevents multiple pregnancies , there are concerns that it might reduce pregnancy rates. A large proportion of infertility patients appear to favour multiple pregnancies as an ideal treatment outcome. As art in malaysia is considered costly and not financially supported by the government , it would be beneficial to assess the patients ' knowledge and preferences on this particular ground. The aim of this study is to determine the preferences on the number of pregnancies among infertility patients and their partners. The research was reviewed and approved by the ummc research ethical board ( irb reference number : 782.3 )  253 respondents completed the questionnaire while the remaining questionnaires were not included in the analysis as they were not fully completed with omitted answers. The mean age of the female and male respondents was 31.7 years and 33.5 years , respectively. More women had received previous treatment as compared to their male counterparts ( 52.1% versus 33.6% ) More patients in our setting considered singleton pregnancy as an ideal treatment outcome even before being exposed to the knowledge of multiple pregnancies itself. Patients who are aware of the increased fetal risks associated with multiple pregnancies were significantly less likely to desire this outcome. This suggests that patients ' prior information and knowledge regarding the risks will reduce their desire of having multiple pregnancies. An empowerment programme which consisted of a decision aid kit, support of a nurse and reimbursement of an additional treatment cycle was developed by van perperstraten et al. Their study reported that patients who were administered the empowerment strategy were more likely to choose elective set. However, the differences between the empowerment and control group was much lower than the estimated goal of 25% based upon power calculations. A higher proportion of patients with infertility actually prefer singleton pregnancy compared to multiple pregnancy. Patients with prior knowledge on the risks of multiple pregnancies were significantly less likely to desire this outcome. For those patients who prefer multiple pregnancies, reinforcing the knowledge on risks did not reduce their desire.\",\n",
       " 'The major pathophysiological feature of glaucoma is optic nerve damage. Neuroprotective compounds are commonly administered orally, intravenously , or intramuscularly and reach ocular tissue via the systemic circulation. Blood - eye barrier brings about a low concentration of the drugs in retina and optic nerve, leading to low efficacy and limited application of neuroprotective drugs.  mouse nerve growth factors ( mngf) were purchased from xiamen beida biological engineering company ( beida , china) A bottle of dried powder of mngF ( 18  g ) was mixed with 0.1  ml of 0.9% sodium chloride ( 18\\xa0 g/0.1\\xa0ml ) before use.

The retina was divided into four quadrants, namely , the supratemporal, the infratemporal , the superior nasal , and the inferior nasal quadrants. The latency and amplitude of p100 in each animal were recorded every 10 minutes. The value of p < 0.05 was considered as statistical significance. inal ganglion cells was higher than that in group b. sporadic vacuolar degeneration could still be seen in retinal gangLion cells. in inner and outer nuclear layer , nuclei were less dyeing , loosely arranged. compared to groups c and d , group e had significantly thicker retina and higher retinal rgcs counts ( p < 0.05 ) ( table 3) High ultrasonic energy or long irradiation time might cause tissue damage. intraocular hypertension could lead to various degrees of cell edema, rgcs loss, optic nerve myelin sheath damage, and decreases in mitochondria, microtubules , and microfilaments. adding ultrasound irradiation can not increase the protective effect of mngf. Ultrasonic microbubbles can effectively and safely enhance recombinant adenoassociated virus delivery to retinal ganglion cells in rats. It may serve as a novel gene delivery method in gene therapy for glaucomatous optic neuroprotection. The expression of bcl - xl protein in transfected and nontransfected rgcs was significantly different. Microbubble and ultrasound irradiation can strengthen its protective effect. nerve damage due to intraocular hypertension. combined usage of microbubble with ultrasound irradiated can strengthen the protective effect of the bubble. microbubbles can help prevent nerve damage from intra-ocular hypertension and other conditions.',\n",

This article describes an atypical case of oca in which the use of optical coherence tomography ( oct) was crucial for establishing the diagnosis. The patient had mild macular dystrophy at the posterior pole and visual acuity was 20/30 in the right eye and 20/40 in the left eye. biomicroscopy of the anterior segment revealed a transparent cornea and normally pigmented iris in both eyes. oct revealed the absence of normal foveal depression and the small elevation of the inner segment / outer segment junction in the fovea. molecular analysis was then performed on the genes involved in albinism and revealed the presence of r402q and 1177delg mutations in the tyr gene. written consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this case report and the accompanying images.  oct can therefore be considered an important diagnostic tool in cases that do not present typical ocular and cutaneous characteristics of a disease. The phenotype described in this report suggests that patients affected by oca associated with r402q and 1177delg tyr gene mutations may present less severe clinical manifestations.',\n",

It is known to be associated with mental impairment, growth deficiency, microcephaly, facial dysmorphia, and skeletal abnormalities. Two genes have been shown to result in this syndrome : crebbp and ep300. mutations affecting crebbP cause approximately 5060% of cases. mutations of ep300 are associated with only 3% of Cases. The patient was heterozygous for a c.1948dela mutation in the ep300 gene. This deletion in exon 10 results in a frameshift mutation and a premature stop codon. This mutation has not been previously reported but is predicted to cause a loss of normal protein function. Our patient has no notable skeletal findings , lacks hirsutism and microcephaly , and the cognitive delays are quite subtle such that she has a normal iq on repeated testing. As the prevalence of wes increases , we will likely find that ep300 mutations are more common , and therefore better understand the full range of associated phenotypes.',\n",

       " 'a large number of animal models, primarily in mice, are available for the study of experimental ibd. The majority of these models are generated by either chemical or immunologic manipulation , or gene targeting. The samp1/yitfc mouse model ofcd - like ileitis fulfills most of the desired criteria and represents an ideal model. congenic  advantages : spontaneous multifactorial disease with increased pathogenic relevance to the human condition. disadvantages : poor breeding ability , increased cost of colony maintenance , and specific etiology unknown.    samp1/yitspontaneous acute and chronic cd - like ileitis , extra - intestinal manifestations ( skin lesions )   runx3chronic colitis , gastric lesions  keratin 8th2-driven colitis. Animal models that use noxious chemicals to induce colitis are used most commonly because they are accessible, inexpensive and relatively easy to induce. However, the resulting inflammation is generally less representative of the specific immunohistopathology present in the inflamed colons of patients with uc or croc.  chemically induced animal models of colitis can be quite useful , however , for the study of acute colonic tissue injury and repair mechanisms. ibd is a t - cell  mediated disease that involves the recruitment of lymphocytes to the inflamed gut mucosa. Such models can be extremely useful for understanding the functional role of a specific gene product in contributing to or protecting against experimental ibd. Both strains show striking similarities to active crohn s ileitis , making them particularly relevant to the human condition and valuable resources for furtheringcd research. The samp1/yitfc mouse strain originally was derived from selective brother  sister mating of parental akr / j mice. By the 20th generation, the strain had lost its senescence - accelerated phenotype. Chronic samp1/yitfc ileitis shows large numbers of activated th1-type polarized cd4 cells within the lamina propria that produce increased levels of intestinal tnf and ifn. The intraepithelial lymphocytic compartment also is shifted toward cd8tcr cells.  samp1/yitfc ileitis can be considered a truly spontaneous model of crohn s ilethritis because the disease presents independent of any need for genetic , chemical , or immunologic manipulation. The disease occurs in virtually 100% of mice by 10 weeks of age and persists for up to 80 weeks. Because of the spontaneous and multifactorial nature of this model, samp 1/y itfc mice can be used to characterize specific new biomarkers including microbiome and metabolomic markers. Tnf mouse model of crohns - like ileitis originally was developed to understand the mechanisms of tnf - driven crohn - like ibd and chronic inflammatory arthritis. mice with intestinal - specific deletion of fas - associated via death domain and caspase-8 - develop small intestinal inflammation and terminal\\xa0ileitis. mice homozygous for the deleted au - rich element ( tnF) overexpress tn f messenger rna and protein and develop early severe inflammatory disease. The samp1/yitfc and tnf mouse models are particularly useful for understanding mechanisms of ibd pathogenesis that may uniquely lead to the development of crohn s ileitis. We summarize some of the important findings from studies performed using these 2 models. The natural course of ileitis may be characterized by multiple immunologically distinct phases. The th2 pathway also may be important during the maintenance phase. The role of il12/il23 and il17 in samp1/yitfc and tnf mice have not been studied fully. Samp1/yitfc mice express increased ileal epithelial toll - like receptor 5 and serum antiflagellin igg antibodies. Tnf overexpressed in the intestinal epithelium can generate chronic ileitis in the absence of extra - intestinal manifestations. The role of mucosal healing and resolution of inflammation is an active area of investigation.  card15/nod2 ( also known as ibd1 ) is a gene associated withcd in human beings. The gene product , nod2 , is an intracellular pattern recognition receptor and key mediator of intestinal innate immunity through sensing of its ligand. Only 10%15% of crohn s patients actually possess mutations within the nod2 gene.  chromosome 6 ( ibdq2) also was linked to ileitis and includes a homolog for the human chr3 ( p21-p26 ) region in which several genome - wide association studies have identified susceptibility loci. The remaining 2 loci on chromosomes 8 and x appear to associate with epithelial changes in samp1/yitfc ilethritis.  murine endoscopy is a useful technology for assessing intestinal inflammation without killing the animal. This nonlethal procedure allows comparative assessments of endoscopic inflammation within a single animal. A validated scoring system allows investigators to systematically quantify the severity of inflammation and the presence of tumors within the murine intestine.  il33 is a th2-polarizing cytokine that is increased in the intestinal epithelium of patients with uc. To determine whether il33 plays a protective or pathogenic role in ibd , de salvo et  al used samp1yit / fc mice to study the role of il33 within the context of chronic intestinal inflammation. The absence of a commensal flora appears preferentially to impact the th2-driven chronic phase of samp1/yitfc ileitis. mesenteric lymph nodes from germ - free mice have decreased numbers of regulatory t cells. transplantation of disease - associated , but not healthy , microbiota transmitted cd - like iletis to germ -free tnf recipients.  mouse models of ibd are extremely useful tools for exploring pathogenic mechanisms of chronic intestinal inflammation. Spontaneous models offer a unique advantage and strong scientific premise. With continuing advances in targeted drug technologies , important mechanistic findings from animal studies now can be translated readily into clinical development of novel therapies to combat these devastating diseases.',\n",

The incidence of surgical complications has been low and most are mild and self - limiting. The most common complications include irritation from the exposed ends of the nails and difficulties with implant removal. Injury to the distal radial physis is avoided by choosing an entry point proximal to the physis using fluoroscopy. All patients had displaced diaphyseal fractures of the radius and ulna. Initial surgeon had inserted the radial nail in a percutaneous manner. flexible nailing was the primary procedure in seven patients. Six of the nine operations were performed by consultant surgeons. Three cases were performed without consultant supervision. Eight patients had an uncomplicated post - operative course and were discharged the day after surgery. dysfunction of thumb extension was noticed early in six patients but the significance was recognised in only one patient who underwent early surgery. Median time from nail insertion to the diagnosis of epl injury was 80  days ( range 7159 ) All diagnoses were made on clinical grounds , although ultrasound examination was performed in five patients.

An estimated 226,870 cases of invasive breast cancer and 63,300 ductal carcinomas in situ ( dcis) will be diagnosed in 2012. breast cancer is increasingly being diagnosed at an early stage allowing treatment with breast conserving surgery ( bcs) Molecular imaging of cancer margin requires a biomarker that is specific to cancer but not the normal breast tissues. One of the most common tacas is tn antigen ( galnac - o - ser / thr ) , a core glycan associated with mucins on the cancer cell surface of more than 90% of human epithelial carcinomas. The recent development of nanomaterials has provided considerable improvement in specificity and sensitivity for tumor imaging. Quantum dots can be directly made in an aqueous environment at room temperature ( aqds ) with their capping ligands directly in place. bioimaging applications of qds include cell labeling and tracking, cell proliferation, sentinel lymph node mapping, brain imaging, molecular beacons for dna detection. The aqds were conjugated to monoclonal tn antigen antibody ( mab ) ( tn218 igm , abcam , nj ) for direct tumor imaging. viability was verified to be greater than 95% using trypan blue ( amresco , solon , oh ) The cells were resuspended at 10 cells per 10  l of pbs, mixed 1  :  1 with matrigel ( bd biosciences , san jose , ca ) and injected subcutaneously in eight - week - old female nude mice. d - tn mab solution for tn - antigen staining of cancer cells. To find the optimal blocking time , fresh livers were washed with tbs for 2  min twice and then immersed in 1% bovine serum albumin ( bsa ) for various amounts of time.

There are two major steps that affect the sensitivity and specificity of aqd - tn mab probe : blocking time and staining time. Different time periods were examined and it was narrowed down to 15 minutes as the sufficient blocking time. The excised tumors were divided into 3 different regions : a tumor region, a muscle region , and an overlap between tumor and muscle or margin region. Aqd - tn mab probe can identify cancer cells in areas that could have been missed by gross examination during tumor removal process. The positive signal was strong enough to identify the outline of the tumor surface. There was no difference between the h&e staining of an aqds - stained tumor and that of a control tumor. There was no difference between the h&e staining of the control tumor and that of an aqds - treated tumor. quantitative grades of ki67 expression were 38.2  5.2% in the control tumors and 31  6.4% in aqd - treated tumors. For p53 expression , the quantitative grades were 38\\xa06  3% and 41.5  3.7% respectively. Aqds allow convenience in handling the probe without the need of a dark room. Unlike fluorophores , aqds can undergo constant light exposure with minimal photobleach. The aqd - tn mab probe does not depend on the physical - mechanical characteristic of the tissue but assessing the differences between normal and cancer at the molecular level. The aqd - tn mab probe was able to stain and identify cancer areas quantitatively in less than 30 minutes. All sides of the tumor are evaluated which give the surgeon the exact location of cancer area. manipulations of the surgical specimen have no impact on the microscopic examination of the operative specimen.

The prevalence of hypertension in young and middle aged kuwaiti citizens of a minimum age of 21 years was determined.  257 participants of different adolescent ages ( 1119 years ) were selected on a volunteer - basis from kuwait university, capacity academy courses and science clubs. weight and height of the participants were measured in a standing position ( bare feet ) using a precision electronic scale ( hd-313 digital weight scale , tanita ) and a stadiometer ( seca 222 , seca ) respectively. after measuring the weight and Height the body mass index ( bmi ) was calculated as weight divided by height squared ( kg / m ) . subjects with a bmi > 30  kg /m were categorized as obese or severely obese according to the extended bmi cut - points. An oscillometric fully - automated wrist device ( bp w100 , microlife , switzerland ) was used to measure bp. bp was measured in a comfortable sitting position two times on the right wrist with the arm supported and the cuff at the level of the heart. percentiles of systolic and diastolic bp were generated using the world health organization ( who ) reference tables for blood pressure levels by age and height percentile. The mean bmi for the non - obese group was 21.7  2.23  kg / m , with no difference between sexes. The mean was significantly greater in males than females by almost 7  mmhg in the middle adolescent stage and 8.5  mm hg in late adolescent stages. There was no significant difference at any adolescent stage when comparing with the mann - whitney test. In the obese group, males as compared to females had a non - significantly higher rate of elevated bp on first screening. The spread along adolescence years was different in both sexes. More than half (70/133 ; 53% ) of the obese subjects had both elevated systolic and diastolic bp. The minimum bmi was 30  kg / m for both sexes and the range was up to 56.4  kg/ m in the obese sample. The bp values were increasing with age , with minimal difference between the early stages of adolescence in the mean systolic bp in females. The association of the presence of obesity with much higher rates of hypertension has been previously established. New guidelines recommend multiple bp measurements at different sessions to define persistent hypertension and prehypertension. In sorof 's study on school - aged children , the prevalence of elevated blood pressure after first , second and third screenings was 19.4% , 9.5% and 4.5%. 68% of adolescent boys and 43% of adolescents diagnosed with prehyperension and hypertension combined on the basis of a single bp measurement had pre Hypertension or hypertension 2 years later.  of the rapid socioeconomic growth in kuwait . actions such as increasing awareness programs in schools in kUwait as well as continuous monitoring of blood pressure in children and adolescents during health center visits have to be emphasized and implemented further, says the report. The report was published by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in cooperation with the Government of the Gambia.\",\n",
       " ' respirator protection factors are defined as contaminant concentration outside the facepiece divided by contaminant concentrations inside thefacepiece. concentration ratio is only valid as a measure of protection factor as long as there are no particle sources or sinks in the system. deposition of particles within the respiratory system can also occur as air is inhaled , leading to apparent protection factors higher than they ought to be. Papr inward leakage was determined by operating the respirator inside a chamber containing co2 as a tracer gas. A breathing machine was used to simulate the effect of a human wearer , but exhaled air from the breathingMachine was collected in a separate container. The presence of the tracerGas in the exhaledAir was quantitative proof of papr inward leaking. Co2 inside the test chamber was continuously being replaced with fresh air passing through the respirator. When co2 concentration had reached its final steady - state value , this concentration was used as the value in exhaled air. There was no other place for co2 to go once it was inhaled than into the exhalation collection container. Breathing machine minute volume is nearly the same as most papr blower flow rates , but peak flows are much higher. Data were collected with an analog - to - digital data acquisition board ( national instruments , austin , tex , usa) Data were connected to the universal serial bus ( usb ) of a pc computer. ak ) represents the volume of air that leaked into the respirator facepiece and was subsequently inhaled by the breathing machine. this came from a co2 mass balance on the respirators. the amount of co2 into the\\xa0respirator was the net leakage volume times the co2 concentration in the ambient air in the chamber surrounding the\\xa0 respirator. Figure 3 shows that blower flow rate for the 3 m breathe easy tight - fitting papr varies throughout the inhalation phase of breathing. exhaled tidal volumes were nearly constant at 2.32 to 2.42  l. The ratio of co2 concentrations in the exhaled breath and enclosing chamber is also shown. The figures also represent nominal leakage volumes for the respirators. The se 400 breath - responsive respirator attempts to maintain positive pressure inside the facepiece. concentration of contaminant inside the respirator shield is nearly the same as outside the shield. The frm 40  apr has a similar flow rate through its filter , but a somewhat lower protection factor. epieces   have shown that flow pathways can twist and curl. placing a contaminant - detection probe in a stagnant zone could yield measurements that probably underestimate contaminant concentration. Some contaminants can deposit or be absorbed in the respiratory system, thus making the respiratory airways into a contaminants filter. Inhaled tidal volumes during physical exertion are normally in the 1.5  l range. Dead volumes larger than 2.53.0  l require larger blower flow rates and may be unnecessary and undesirable. There has been concern expressed when the pressure inside a respirator facepiece intended to be positive pressure that becomes negative momentarily. The tracer gas used in this study was co2 , and we did not allow co2 to challenge the filter ; each filter inlet was supplied by clean air. perfect filter efficiency was assumed, and we were mainly interested in respirator leakage. If a different gas was used , one that the filter should remove , then the inlet to the filter could be in contact with the same atmosphere that surrounds the respirator.  different facial configurations could channel leakage flows differently in different people. Some facial configurations result in large leaks , and thus, lower protection factors. If contaminated air can leak from outside the facepiece into the inhaled breath , then blower air can flow directly out of the face piece. This represents inefficient use of blower capacity.  blower effectivenesses for both the centurion max and 3 m hood were greater than 1.0. The flow situation inside the respirator face piece is complex , involving air leaking in as well as out simultaneously. Some of the blower air leaks out , probably through the exhalation valve.',\n",
       " ' protein interactions underpin the electron - transfer ( et ) pathways of respiration. One example of a transient et complex is that between cytochrome c and cyto chrome c oxidase. This results in an intricate electron-transfer network that may be better suited to successful colonization of habitats with changing resources. me flavocytochrome c3 ( fcc3 ) fumarate reductase ( nrfa ) , iron - reducing small tetraheme cytochrome ( stc ) ,  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 and a nitrite reduct enzyme ( nRfa) electrons generated during catabolism are donated to the mq-7 pool, which is reoxidized by cyma. cyma transfers the electrons to the periplasmic enzyme flavocy tochrome C3 (fcc3) ( figure 1a) Figure 1b shows the interaction between cyma and fCC3 (figure 1b) Formation of a long - lived complex between cyma and fcc3 was found to retune the catalytic bias of cyma toward oxidation. This ability of protein  protein interactions to modulate the redox bias of redox enzymes reveals a new mechanism by which the magnitude and direction of electron flux through respiratory et networks can be regulated. Full - length recombinant cyma and cymasol were confirmed by mass spectrometry, n - terminal sequencing, and/or immunoblotting. cyma was reconstituted using a method based on that of carter et al. on the day of reconstitution. Vesicles were prepared by extrusion through a 200 nm nucleopore track - etched polycarbonate membrane. Qcm - d experiments were performed with 2% ( w / w ) cyma while the electrochemistry was done with 1%. All solutions were purged with n2 and stored in the glovebox at least 24 h before use. All bilayers were formed using 0.5 mg / ml lipid vesicles in water containing 10 mm cacl2.  electrochemical experiments were carried out with ultraflat template stripped gold electrodes. 150 nm of 99.99% gold ( goodfellows ) was evaporated on silicon wafers using an edwards auto 306 evaporator at < 2 mbar. 1.2 cm glass slides were glued to the gold layer with epo - tek 377 and cured for 2 h at 120  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 c. A bespoke glass spectro - electrochemical cell was assembled using a standard three - electrode setup. The cell was used in a steel mesh faraday cage to minimize electrical noise. All experiments were conducted inside an n2-filled glovebox ( mbraun labmaster ) where the o2 levels were < 1 ppm.  qcm - d was used to monitor the association of fcc3 with cyma - containing inner membrane architectures assembled on silicon - oxide surfaces. protein that was not bound to the ssm was washed out by rinsing the cell five times with buffer. ssm formation was confirmed by a drop in frequency of 2627 hz.  cvs are shown ( a ) before and after addition of ( b ) 0.1 m cymasol , ( c ) 5 m fcc3 , ( d ) 1 mm fumarate ( after rinsing unbound fCC3 from solution ) , and ( d) 1 mmfumarate/10 m hqno. The ssm was formed with liposomes ( 90:10 popc : cardiolipin ; 1% ( w / w ) mq-7 ) . For clarity reasons, only the traces after the formation of the ssm are shown. Mq-7 content in the ssm is given in weight percentages relative to the lipid weight in the liposomes. exposure of cyma - containing ssms to fcc3 results in a decrease in frequency to 55 hz. The dissipation rises by approximately 2 units ( figure 2a ) . this indicates that fCC3 binds to ssms as a layer exhibiting some viscosity , such that  it is not fully elastic. The location of cyma in the ssms used for these experiments can not be controlled. Tight binding of cymasol to ssms was observed within minutes from solutions containing approximately 0.1 m \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0cymasol ( figure 2d) The ratio of fcc3 bound per cyma is 1:3. Even allowing for the possibility that fCC3 partly  replaces cyma on the ssm surface, the ratio is significantly lower. Sms containing cyma(sol)-fcc3 complexes and mq-7 were assembled on gold electrode surfaces and studied by electrochemistry. ssms were formed from cyma proteoliposomes by self - assembly on ultrasmooth gold electrodes that had been modified with submonolayers of cholesterol. Cyma - fcc3 complex is able to oxidize mq-7 in ssms. This is in stark contrast to our previous studies of cyma in contact with mk-7 containing liposomes. To establish whether fCC3 is responsible for the change  in the catalytic bias of Cyma, the activity of cyMA in the membrane - modified  electrodes was measured in the absence of fcc 3. The reduction potential of ferricyanide ( + 420 mv ) is higher than that of fumarate ( 30 mv) This suggests that mq-7 oxidation by the cyma - fcc3 complex is not driven solely by thermodynamics. The catalytic currents displayed by cymasol are 45 -fold lower than those for the ssms containing full - length cyma. S. oneidensis mr-1 has become an important model organism for bioreactor, bioengineering, and bioremediation studies. Its ability to transfer electrons from the oxidation of organic compounds or hydrogen to extracellular minerals and electrodes has inspired many to investigate applications in microbial - fuel cell technology. Cyma forms a transient low - affinity complex with fcc3 with a kd of 0.4 mm. The electron flux through cyma will be sufficient to support anaerobic respiration of s. oneidensis mr-1. The formation of a protein protein complex can influence the catalytic activity or bias of redox enzymes. Redox reactions are limited by different rate - limiting steps. The rate of h2 oxidation is defined by the rate of et along a redox chain. The reduction potentials of the hemes in cyma lie between 110 and 265 mv. This is lower than that of mq-7 ( 70 mv)  mq-7 oxidation is regulated by controlling  the rate of et along the heme redox chain. the magnitude and direction of electron flux through respiratory et  networks can be regulated. cyma is rate limiting  for cyma in isolation, but cyma can be treated with antibiotics.',\n",
       " 'There has been no distinct asian definition for cachexia so far. A simple quotation from the global definition of cachexia has been included in the clinical guidelines for infusion therapy in advanced cancer patients 2013 edited by the japanese society for palliative medicine. There seems to be only one epidemiological research study using weight loss as a part of the definition. Many reports had criteria including only bmi cutoff of 18.5  kg / m , which is related to the world health organization definition of malnutrition. according to the epidemiologic data with bmi , onethirds of japanese heart failure patients had a bmi < 20.3 kg /m   23 whereas the prevalence of underweight ( bmi  was 13.6% in reports from western countries. These data may suggest that there are more cachectic heart failure Patients in japan than in western countries , or that the use of the same definition as in west countries can overestimate the prevalence. There is no published interventional research targeting cachexia in cancer, heart failure , and ckd. Most of the studies in cancer and heart failure focused on blood levels of hormones or cytokines in those with and without cachexia. The clinical course and background of cachectic patients in japan may be different from that of patients in western countries. More studies are needed to assess the epidemiologic / pathological background as well as the effect of therapeutic approach.',\n",
       " \"Chronic periodontitis is one of the classical complications of diabetes. It is characterized by destruction of periodontal connective tissues and tooth supporting bone. This process is guided by the host immune - inflammatory reaction in response to putative pathogenic bacteria that are embedded in dental plaque.  type 2 diabetes is associated with higher gingival crevicular fluid ( gcf ) levels of rankl. a good surrogate marker for periodontitis - induced bone destruction. a positive correlation between rankl / opg ratios in gcf and glycated hemoglobin ( hba1c ) has been also observed. The study protocol was approved by the ministry of health in sudan and the norwegian research ethics committee at the university of bergen. Written informed consents were obtained from all participants and the steps of the oral clinical examination and the sampling procedures were explained. Participants were diagnosed as having chronic periodontitis if they had at least two sites with bleeding pockets of 4  mm ( not on the same tooth ) Bacterial dna was extracted and purified using the masterpure dna purification kit according to the manufacturer 's instructions. pooled samples were suspended in 300  l te buffer and incubated overnight with 1  l lysozyme solution at 37c. next day finally the dna pellet was washed with ethanol and resuspended in 25  l Te buffer. amount of dna measured for each sample by nanodrop nd-1000 spectrophotometer. conventional polymerase chain reaction ( pcr) was performed under standard conditions to investigate the prevalence of p. gingivalis. The target genes were amplified in a thermocycler. Negative control ( master mix without dna template ) was included in each pcr run. The stained dna bands were visualized by ultraviolet light and the data were reported as present or absent. Potential differences in demographic and clinical indicators between the study groups were tested using chi - square and fisher 's exact test. The distributions of the demographic and clinical indicators across the study groups are presented in table 1. Thecp group had the highest prevalence of p. gingivalis ( 81.5% ) , followed by dm + cp ( 59.3% ) and dm ( 55.0% ) groups ( p > 0.05) The prevalence of t. forsythia was 100% in both periodontitis groups compared to 90% in the dm group. The levels of the molecules under investigation did not differ significantly between well - controlled and poorly controlled type 2 diabetes patients. Mmp-9 levels remained higher in subjects with positive p. gingivalis and p. intermedia scores than in those with negative scores. In patients with type 2 diabetes , the concentration of opg did not discriminate between those with and without p.Gingival is one of the keystone pathogens in chronic periodontitis. In the present study, the dm + cp group had worse clinical periodontal parameters. There were no significant differences in the levels of salivary mmp-8 and mMP-9 between the study groups. opg levels increase in response to increased osteoclastogenesis. The level of glycemic control did not affect the concentrations of molecules under investigation.  type 1 diabetes concluded that those with diabetes had higher plasma concentration of opg and lower rankl / opg ratio compared to individuals without diabetes. In contrast , an experimental study among rats demonstrated that type 1 Diabetes influences periodontal bone tissues. The study design of the present study ( cross - sectional ) might contribute to the absence of association observed between type 2 diabetes and the investigated salivary molecules. Large follow- up studies are needed to trace the potential effect of type 2 Diabetes on bacterial composition of dental plaque and on bone remodeling markers in oral fluids.\",\n",

       " 'Thiol - stabilized gold nanoparticles have attracted significant research interest in recent years because of their importance in both fundamental science and technological applications. Despite the large volume of literature relating to synthesis, morphological development and assembling, only a few studies exist on further structural development such as low - temperature coalescence and grain growth based on self - organized structures. Here , we describe the growth of thiol - stabilize gold nanoparticle by low - Temperature heat - induced ( 323 k ) coalescence on amorphous carbon film. The gold colloid was split into 5 ml parts and 1-dodecanethiol was added to each part. The particles were separated from the solutions by ethanol precipitation. The morphology of the particles prepared on the copper grid was directly characterized by transmission electron microscopy. Figure 2 shows tem images of 2d and 3d gold nanocrystals with various annealing times at 323 k. Four samples were prepared simultaneously and each sample was examined with tem to observe its general crystal configuration. With increasing annealed time from as - prepared ( fig . 2d ) , the particles aggregated more and more , and finally changed to single or twinned crystals. The formation of gold nanoparticles through reduction of aucl3 was examined by observing the change in the absorption band centered at 525 nm. With increasing reaction time the absorption bands red - shifted from 525 nm ( as - synthesized ) to 565 nm ( 24 h annealing ) and the peak sharpness decreased , indicating an increase in particle size. The increased interparticle attraction probably arises from thiol desorption. As capping ligands desorb the steric stability of the nanocrystals decreases and the inclination to aggregate increases. The growth of self - organized gold nanoparticles at relatively low temperature ( 323 k ) occurs in three steps. The gold nanoparticle cores approach each other because of van der waals attraction and then coalesce. The attracting gold cores grow into larger single and/or twinned crystals via the diffusion and rearrangement of gold atoms. The present finding implies us the usefulness and advantage of this method. The dynamic motion of thiol molecules is the key to the growth of other shapes and sizes at the processing temperature. the exothermic formation of disulfide bonds . we therefore suggest that the dynamic motion is theKey to the Growth of Other shapes and Size at the Processing temperature.',\n",
       " 'Physical activity is promoted as beneficial for a variety of diseases affecting middle - aged and older adults. activity levels are also relevant to total joint arthroplasty ( tja ) surgery where postsurgical activity level is considered to be an important clinical outcome measure. differences in activity levels have been shown to affect the rate of polyethylene wear , a critical factor in implant longevity. 41 women and 13 men ( out of 65 total recruited ) met the inclusion criteria for the study and were compliant with wearing the activity monitoring device for a seven - day period. The device calculates the number of steps taken during level walking excluding stair - climbing activities. seven trials were collected for each subject, three trials at a self - selected  normal speed and two each at fast and slow speeds. Eleven (5f/6  m) healthy , non - tja volunteers age 28.8  5.5 ( range : 1941 ) years old were asked to wear the activity monitor while walking on a treadmill. acceleration, top self - selected speed, deceleration , and travel distance of the treadmill were adjusted and programmed for each volunteer. intraclass correlation coefficients ( icc ( 2,1 ) ) were used to determine whether data from the activity Monitor were in agreement with the optical tracking system. The study population was divided into three groups based on their mean number of steps per day according to the classification scheme outlined by tudor - locke and bassett. The subjects averaged 61,691  25,274 steps over the seven - day period ranging from a minimum of 12,298 steps to a maximum of 148,180 steps. The day - to-day variation in activity of the entire cohort revealed a sinusoidal pattern of activity level. The study included older adults without any evidence of clinical osteoarthritis in the hips and knees. The average number of steps taken per day was close to 9000 , which is approximately 4000 steps per day greater than has been previously reported in individuals after total joint arthroplasty. The data suggest that patients who undergo arthro plasty do not typically attain the same level of physical activity. Those with a higher bmi tended to be less active. Age did not explain variance in average daily step count. The results are consistent with existing literature that suggests that bmi is inversely correlated with physical activity in patients after knee and hip replacement. One limitation of this work is the skewed distribution of males and females within the study population. It is projected that patients under the age of sixty - five will account for more than 50% of all knee arthroplasty ( tka ) patients by the years 2011 and 2016. The fastest growing age group for tka is individuals aged 4554 , with the demand projected to increase 17-fold by 2030.',\n",

The procedure was planned using electrosurgery unit for the right side and scalpel technique for the left side of the maxillary arch. The patient requested for any cosmetic therapy which would eventually enhance the esthetics on smiling. The patient 's history revealed that the blackish discoloration of gingiva was present since birth suggestive of physiologic melanin pigmentation. The degree of vascularization , the thickness of the keratinized layer , and the amount of pigment containing cells will determine the color. There are few studies published so far regarding clinical methods of treatment of pigmented gingiva. The use of the scalpel technique for the depigmentation is most economical compared to other techniques, which require more advanced armamentarium. scalpel surgery causes unpleasant bleeding during and after the operation , and it is necessary to cover the surgical site with periodontal dressing for 710 days.\",\n",
       " ' gamma knife radiosurgery ( gks) has been proposed as an alternative option to open surgery for intractable mtle. non - invasiveness and safety are major advantages of gks over open surgery. The clinical significance of gk for mtle has been the subject of controversy. The patient showed mild hypometabolism in the left temporal lobe compared to the right side. neuropsychological test revealed moderate mental retardation and diffuse cerebral dysfunction in both frontal and temporal lobes. He was maintained on anti - seizure medications including topiramate , levetiracetam , and oxcarbazepine. The patient has been free from seizures since 9 months after gks.

Fractionated gks aims to integrate the advantages of fractionated conventional radiotherapy and single - session radiosurgery. Radiation delivered accurately permits larger doses to be delivered to larger areas without increasing the complication rate. reducing dose per fraction could be an attractive alternative with minimizing adverse radiation effects and preserving the remaining function of medial temporal structures. ion , contrast enhancement , and surrounding vasogenic edema have been reported to appear approximately 9 months to 1 year after gks and gradually regressed within a few years.

       " \"migraine is a prevalent primary headache disorder that affects approximately 10% to 20% of the general population. restless legs syndrome is a sleep - related sensorimotor disorder first described in 1945 by the swedish neurologist ekbom. rls is characterized by uncomfortable sensations in the legs and an overwhelming urge to move the legs, especially when at rest and during nighttime. The taiwanese national health insurance program ( nhird) covers 99.9% of the population. We used the longitudinal health insurance database 2000 ( lhid 2000 ) to conduct the study. The study was approved by the ethics review board of china medical university ( cmu - rec-101012 ) The national health insurance ( nhi) program is a compulsory single - payer healthcare system covering 99.9% of taiwan 's population at the end of 2014. The lhid 2000 includes the 1996 to 2011 medical claims of 1 million beneficiaries randomly selected from the 23.75 million nhi beneficiaries. We used sas 9.4 software ( sas institute , cary , nc ) to manage and analyze the data. The study was approved by the ethics review board of china medical university ( cmu - rec-101012 ) . we conducted a population - based retrospective cohort study by selecting participants aged 20 years and older who were newly diagnosed with migraine. migraine diagnoses were identified according to the international classification of headache disorders. We included 23,641 patients with migraine and 94,564 subjects without migraine. The comorbidities of diabetes ( 7.96% versus 7.17% ) , ida ( 3.47% versus 2.06% ) and depression ( 9.93% versus 3.51% ) were more prevalent in the migraine cohort. During an average follow-up period of 7.38 years , we observed a higher incidence density rate of rls in the. migraine cohort than in the nonmigraine cohort. . adjusted hazard ratio ( ahr ) of rls was 1.42-fold higher ( 95% confidence interval [ ci ]  =  1.131.79 ) for the migraine cohort than for the. nonmigraine cohort. compared with younger patients , the risk of. rls is 1.62-foldHigher in patients > 60 years , suggesting that rls risk increases with age. in the multivariable model, the risk was higher for the patients with comorbidities of ida, depression, anxiety, sleep disorder, parkinson disease and renal disease. The risk of subsequent development of rls in patients with migraine was 1.42-fold higher than in the nonmigraine cohort after adjustment for age, sex, and medical comorbidities. This is the first nationwide , population - based longitudinal study that demonstrates an increased risk of rl in patients. In our study cohorts , the rls occurrence showed no clear sex - dependent predisposition ( table 2 ) , unlike the many studies where a higher rls prevalence was reported in females than in males. Our data showed a high ahr for rls in elderly patients ( > 60 years ) and patients with the comorbidity of ida, depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, or parkinson disease. The association of dopamine and rls is more tenuous, although central dopaminergic hypofunction of hypothalamic neurons ( a11 ) targeting the spinal cord have been implicated in rls pathophysiology.  iron deposition in the brain is considered to be involved in migraine pathogenesis. Increased iron accumulation appears to be associated with repeated migraine attacks. iron deficiency also appears to play a role in the etiology and pathogenesis of rls. Previous studies have pointed to a common genetic origin for rls and migraine located on chromosome 14q21. The nhird dataset is derived from an administrative database that lacks detailed clinical data. The precise diagnosis of idiopathic or secondary rls was not available in this database.

The reporting and coding of a surgical procedure is a major factor used to determine the preset pps payment. Medicare trend data for selected calendar years 1977 - 87 are presented in table 1. The data show that the proportion of surgical discharges for aged hi enrollees increased from 33 percent of all discharges in 1977 to 61 percent in 1987. The northeast region showed the largest increase ( 95 percent ) in the surgical rate. of insertion of prosthetic lens dropped 88 percent from 1983 to 1987. The north central region had the highest surgical rate among the regions in 1977 ( 115 discharges per 1,000 hi enrollees in 1977) and the lowest rate in 1987 ( 185 discharge per 1,.000 enrollees) The largest number of discharges ( 236,000 ) was reported for icd-9-cm code 60.2 ( transurethral prostatectomy) The highest rates of. ssh inpatient surgical procedures per1,000 aged hi. enrollees were reported for : icD-9.cm code 51.22 ( total cholecystectomy4.3 of every 1, thousand enrollees ) . icd.9- cm code 79.35 ( open reduction of. the abdominal Surgical rate per 1,000 enrollees for icd-9-cm code 13.59 ( other extracapsular extraction of lens) ranged from 0.2 in the west region to 2.4 in the northeast , a difference of 1100 percent. Of all the ambulatory surgical centers ( 897 ) in the united states as of january 1988 , only 97 centers were located in the northeastern region.  differences in the alos per discharge among the census regions were substantial for many of the leading surgical procedures. icd-9-cm code 79.35 ( open reduction of fracture with internal fixation of femur) had an average charge ranging from $ 9,384 in the north central region to $ 11,956 in the northeast , a difference of 27 percent. the largest regional variation in alos for the leading. surgical procedures was shown for transurethral prostatectomy. annual surgical rate per 1,000 enrolleesa ratio of the total number of discharges with inpatient surgery ( multiplied by 1,.000 ) to the number of persons entitled to benefits as of july 1 of that year. general and special hospitals certified as participating facilities under medicare and reporting average stays of fewer than 25 days. all discharges including those persons who died during their hospitalization are included. A complete count of medicare discharges from short - stay hospitals in 1987 will probably amount to about 3 percent more than the total figures used in this study. The incompleteness of the medpar ( medicare provider analysis and review ) stay record files used to prepare this article is a result of the inherent administrative time lag between the time when a bill is submitted for payment and when it is posted to central records.',\n",

The presence of this sign does not affect visual prognosis or the response to intravitreal treatment, except where this sign is located subfoveally.',\n",
       " \" intradialytic hypotension ( idh ) during hemodialysis ( hd) continues to be a main problem in patients with esrd ( end - stage kidney disease ) We reviewed clinical and experimental literature in a variety of sources regarding the possible effect of vasopressin administration in prevention of hypotension during hd to clarify its mechanism, efficacy, and safety. Many factors can contribute to hemodialysis hypotension. Different strategies with variable success rate have been offered to prevent or diminish idh. vasopressin is a well- recognized vasoconstrictor. The role of vasopressedin insufficiency has also been proposed in hypotension during hd. Vasopressin ( avp) is derived from a preprohormone precursor. It is released in the setting of hyperosmolality or nonosmotic stimuli, including volume depletion, hypotension, and nausea or vomiting. Its antidiuretic property has been exploited clinically for the management of patients with diabetes insipidus and nocturnal enuresis. Vasopressin is a well - recognized vasoconstrictor by increment of peripheral vascular resistance via v1a receptors activation on vascular smooth muscle. It appears that this effect is negligible in healthy individuals. In the setting of hypotension and hypovolemia , the hemodynamic response to vasopress in becomes an important compensatory mechanism in maintaining arterial pressure. Vasopressin infusion may be an effective therapy to prevent idh episodes. Clinical trials on the vasopressedin effect on prevention of idh are scant. The osmotic stimulation of vasopressesin secretion by hypertonic solutions has an important role in increasing blood pressure among patients. Vasopressin has been shown to be effective in the prevention of hypotension during hemodialysis. In a double blinded and placebo - controlled clinical trial of beladi mousavi et al. blood pressure was more stable and the incidence of symptomatic hypotension did not increase among the patients receiving constant infusion of a nonpressor dose of vasopressedin. Administration of exogenous vasopressingin may improve cardiovascular stability and facilitates volume removal during hd.  hypotension during hemodialysis is the most common and important side effect of hd. The incidence of this problem is very high and ranges from 15% to 50% of dialysis sessions. Arginine vasopressin is widely recognized for its role in the regulation of sodium balance and antidiuretic properties. The daily transcript is a written version of each day's featured news stories.

       " 'The incidence of acute myocardial infarction ( ami) commands one of the highest mortality rates in the us and around the world. each year, approximately 635,000 people suffer from ami, among whom it is estimated that 50% will die within the first hour of symptoms. interests have intensified in plasma biochemical markers to predict susceptibility and aid in patient management. Label - free biosensors to detect myoglobin levels have been used to detect cardiac biomarkers. This paper reports label - free bioassays of myoglobin with a novel photonic - crystal - based sensor. The optical biosensor is designed based on a photonic crystal structure used in a total - internal - reflection configuration. A broadband light is introduced into the sensor substrate at an incidence angle of 64 through a prism. Our sensor is unique in the fact that it utilizes an open optical microcavity as opposed to a conventional closed optical microCavity. When molecular bindings occur on the cavity layer surface , the wavelength of the resonant dip in the reflectance spectrum of the sensor shifts in a manner highly sensitive to analyte binding. through monitoring the shift in the resonate dip , a real - time detection of the molecular binding can be performed. Carboxyl methylated ( cm ) dextran ( 150  kda ) is covalently conjugated onto the sensor surface via edc / nhs chemistry to maximize the binding sites of cardiac myoglobin antibodies. the activated cm - dexran then reacts with the amine groups on the surface for 4 hours at room temperature. finally, the immobilized cm -Dexran reacts with 200  l antibodies to functionalize the sensor for specific detection of myoglobin. Two microfluidic channels are connected to a multichannel syringe pump. The flow of cardiac myoglobin samples or buffer solutions onto the sensing areas is precisely controlled. The reflected light from the two microchannels on the sensor is collected using a high - resolution spectrometer ( hr4000 , ocean optics ) The sensor is prepared for myoglobin assays due to the immobilization of the cardiac myoglobin antibodies on the sensor surface. A 200  l cardiacMyoglobin solution in pbs is injected through one microchannel on the newly prepared sensor. The amount of cardiac myoxide binding to the sensor is quantified by analysis of the corresponding resonant dip shift. Saturation of binding has been observed at higher myoglobin concentrations. The final resonant wavelength shift of 0.25  nm for 1000  ng / ml of myoglobin corresponds to a binding thickness of myoglobin of\\xa00.30  nm. Our experimental result indicates that a pc - tir can be functionalized for sensitive detection of  myoglobin with a concentration ranging from 70 to 1000 ng /ml. We used myoglobin samples at two high concentrations for the binding assays with our pc - tir sensor. The binding curves are plotted in figure 6 , which shows that equilibrium has been reached at two levels corresponding to the two concentrations used. From the sensor responses at the equilibrium levels and based on ( 2 ) , the kd of myoglobin bound with antibodies on the sensor surface was calculated to be 1.2  nm. A combination blood test of ctni and myoglobin may allow the achievement of high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. A sensitive biosensor is needed for rapid detection right after the onset of the elevation of myoglobin concentrations. The sensor detection limit is as low as 70  ng / ml , which falls in the clinical diagnostic level of ami patients.',\n",
       " 'The method in uses matched filtering , thresholding , thinning and linear classifier algorithm to obtain vessel tree. A classification rate of 91% of blood vessel segmentation and 95% of the vessel network was achieved. The method in   uses matched filtered , thresholded , thining and linearclassifier algorithm. Some relatively new vessel segmentation techniques which work well for normal images have been reported. The three techniques ilcs, eeed , and ca are novel and the fourth technique mmf is an improved and modified version of the existing technique called matched filtering. The images presented in this paper were either taken from stare   or from alexandra eye pavilion hospital , edinburgh , uk. Four techniques are used to extract blood vessels from abnormal retinal images. We have also tested these four techniques on 105 normal retina images with higher success rates. We are describing these four methods for bve one by one in the following sections. technique is one of the most cited techniques in literature and has been included to make comparison with other techniques. The method has been implemented on 30 highly abnormal retinal images. 78% efficiency was achieved for high contrast thick blood vessels and for low contrast blood vessels the efficiency varied from 74 to 78% depending upon the contrast of the blood vessels against background. thin blood vessels with contrast as small as 0.01 were extracted with 77% efficiency using the proposed method. Eeed is a novel edge enhancement and edge detection technique to extract blood vessels from retinal images. The main objectives of the eeed technique are to enhance the contrast of blood vessels and at the same time diffuse the other abnormal features present in the retinal image. To demonstrate the capability of eeed we have chosen an image shown in figure 8(a) which is low in contrast and contains a large number of drusen spread over the entire image. For the extraction of blood vessels with eeed , a retinal image is first convolved with a large gaussian blurring kernel. The minimum image is then blurred a little bit with a gaussianblurring technique with a small kernel. This is then convolved  with a log filter with a kernel size of ( 9 , 9 ) The resultant image is contrast enhanced and contrast reversed with more prominent vessel trees. The image in figure 8(c) is a vessel enhanced image on a nonuniform background. The image was then convolved with a gaussian blurring kernel of  = 1. This process helps to develop continuity in the vessel tree structure. The noise in the image shown in Figure 8(f) can be removed using a number of techniques. A matched filter technique has been presented for the purpose of enhancement of blood vessels in retinal images. 80 to 85% was the success rate in obtaining correct vessel trees by mmf without human intervention. blood vessels seem to follow an inverted gaussian profile with the width of the vessels varying from 2 pixels to 10 pixels for a standard image. S(t) is used in the theory of communication. We suggest an inverted gaussian to act as a matched filter for the enhancement of blood vessels in retinal images. ideally the matched filter must have all possible orientations and varying thickness to enhance vessels with differentorientations and thicknesses. The optimal filter to act as a matched filter for the vessels may be written as given by . the negative sign implies that the vessels are darker than the background. The matched filter above is valid only for a segment of the vessels of certain gaussian width. For vessels other than along the y - axis , the filter above needs to be rotated. The application of matched filtering with these orientations generates 21 images. In order to get the coordinates of the blood vessels we need to threshold the image obtained after the matched filtering technique. The selection of an adequate threshold of the grey - level for extracting objects of interest from background is very important. In the ideal case the histogram for the image should be bimodal . ideally there is a deep and sharp valley between these two peaks. The retinal image is split into two levels at the value of k. The method of finding the threshold has also been tested for multilevel thresholding. The algorithm worked well by splitting the image into three classes but was unable to classify that darker region into a single separate class. In order to extract the coordinates of blood vessels in the matched filtered image we have applied the algorithm. The image in figure 13(a) is modified when the black surrounding corners are replaced with the image mean value. This information is gathered from the image histogram which gives a distinct peak for the background. The method for the extraction of blood vessels is further modified to improve the quality of the extracted blood vessel tree. In this approach the image background at corners is modified and then a homomorphic filter is applied. The image is automatically thresholded using the otsu algorithm keeping the information below the threshold value unchanged and giving the rest of the image the same value as the threshold. 100% correct results have been obtained for thresholding the image by this method. We have tried to prevent information ( other than blood vessels ) being enhanced with the use of matched filters by making an effort to enhance contrast of the blood vessels and at the same time to reduce contrast of background features. It has been found that if an image contains thin blood vessels then by using a kernel of small width these blood vessels can be enhanced. One can try kernels of different widths and a detailed tree can be extracted. At certain points where the width of the blood vessels is more than the width measured by the matched filtering method one can observe an exact overlap. In the proposed technique called continuation algorithm ( ca ) we generate two binary tree images of the given retinal image and process them to obtain a noise free continued segments vessel tree. The two binary images can be generated using matched filtering techniques [ 1 , 10 , 18 , 19 ] We have used the matched filtering technique for the extraction of binary tree as it provides appropriate control to obtain two pre - requisite images for our proposed continuation algorithm. Two binary vessel trees are extracted from a retinal image using the matched filter technique. The main drawback of the matched filtering technique is that it is poor at extracting noise - free thin vessels. The tree extension obtained in the first step is shown in figure 18(a) The image after the second application of the algorithm is then flipped horizontally and used to extend the tree. The algorithm has been tested on 30 images for vessel tree extraction and the performance has been found to be satisfactory. Each technique was tested on the same set of 30 highly abnormal poor quality retinal images. The four techniques in the order of increased simplicity are mmf, ilcs, eeed , and ca. mmf being relatively more complex has been discussed in greater detail. The four techniques ( ilcs , eeed , mmf , and ca ) were run for the image in figure 1(a) on the machine : pentium(r) d cpu 3.4  ghz, 2  gb of ram, microsoft windows xp professional service pack 2 version 2002 and mathematica 4.1 in a stand - alone mode. The techniques ca and eeed were found to be fully automatic and even a human intervention could not improve the results obtained with them. These techniques when analysed on normal retinal images gave improved results. The existing vessel tree extraction techniques either give up the extraction of thinnest part of vessel trees or produce images with a lot of noise. The existing techniques do not seem to give reasonable solution when applied to the poor quality images like the ones as shown in figure 1. The proposed method based on continuation algorithm seems to give accurate results. It retrieves noise free vessel tree images and at the same time preserves thinner vessel segments in the vessel trees. The method of matched filtering includes some preprocessing of the retinal images. In the ordinary or conventional method, a matched filter is directly convolved with a retinal image. This method also enhances nonvessel structure in the binary vessel tree. A square window of size ( x , x ) pixels is centred at each pixel position. Vessel tree structure greatly improved as compared with that obtained using only the conventional matched filter technique. Success rate of the ca method was 95% to 99% when tested over 30 abnormal retinal images which approach to 99 - 100. We have also introduced a multimatched filtering technique in which a preprocessed retinal image is convolved with matched filters. The technique is superior to existing vessel tree extraction techniques and the other three techniques ( ilcs , eeed , and mmf ) We conclude that the four techniques for vessel tree. extraction from retinal images are good additions to the existing vessel segmentation techniques. The two techniques : eeed and ca , are especially important as they satisfied the human graders who recommended these two techniques for bve from retina images on commercial grounds.',\n",

       " 'plasmacytoid dendritic cells ( pdcs) are the main producers of type i interferons ( ifn - i) in response to foreign nucleic acids. They can also differentiate into antigen presenting cells ( apcs) to directly stimulate and modulate t cell responses. They have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many human inflammatory diseases and their mouse models. Pdcs modulate the course of eae after disease onset. We found that when transferred during acute eae phase , pdcs led to dramatic disease remission. Our work reinforces and validates the relevance of emerging therapeutic concepts regarding the use of cell therapies for autoimmune diseases. Eae mice were treated at indicated time points with -neta ( abcam ) ( 10  mg / kg / daily ) , dt ( 100  ng / mouse ) , or 10  g / ml of mog35 - 55 peptide in pbs. mice were monitored daily for disease clinical symptoms , and blindly scored as follows. Bm cells were stained with the following biotinylated lineage markers. Data were acquired in a cyan adp ( beckman coulter) for flow cytometry analysis of dcs. Single cell suspensions were incubated with fcblock ( anti - cd16/32 fcriii ) for 10 min at 4 c.  intracellular cytokine stainings were done with the cytofix / cytoperm kit ( bd ) for ifn- and il-17 staining. cell proliferation was assessed by flow cytometry using anti  human ki67 and respective isotype control. In order to explore a potential therapeutic role for pdcs in eae , we adoptively transferred in  vitro bone marrow ( bm )  clinical scores of control non pdc - injected mice continued to rise. Those of pdc- injected mice stayed stable for few days post - pdc transfer. These clinical scores then rapidly decreased, resulting in a significant inhibition of eae. mice presenting a clinical score of 3 at the time of pDC transfer either significantly recovered or exhibited stabilized disease development. To determine the mechanisms accounting for pdc - mediated eae amelioration , we analysed the body distribution of injected bm - pdcs derived from ubiquitin - gfp mice. Two days post - injection, gfp pdts were detectable in ln, spleen and inflamed sc. A very low frequency of gfp Pdcs was observed in the liver and the bm. Pdc transfer in eae mice increases hematopoietic cell generation in the bm. This leads to enhanced cdc and pdc frequencies in slos. At the same time point, bm - resident pdcs exhibited an upregulation of ly49q. This suggests that these cells might play a protective role locally in the cns. ioration following mog35 - 55 loaded pdc transfer was totally abrogated in dt treated mice ( fig . 3d ) . therefore, endogenous pdc recruitment to sc after pDC transfer is mandatory to confer eae protection. Although a specific receptor mediating pdc migration to inflamed tissues has not yet been identified , different chemokines and chemotactic factors have been related to pdc homing. elioration are still incompletely understood . in order to check whether ifn- was involved in pdc - mediated protection in eae , we transferred ifn or wt mog35 - 55 loaded pdcs into eae recipient mice. Both wt and ifn - pdc mediated the same level of disease inhibition. These results firmly rule out a role for ifn  in disease ameliorating induced by pdc transfer. We analysed pdc phenotype in sc of eae mice. irrespective of pdc transfer, cns pdcs expressed lower levels of cd86 compared tocdcs. The expression of cd69 by endogenous pccs was substantially downregulated upon pdcTransfer. These findings suggest that the inflammatory status of pdc in sc from eae mouse was markedly altered following pdc Transfer.  transferred pdcs rapidly reached the sc , localized in lesion areas in the cns. selective depletion of endogenous pdc completely abrogated disease amelioration following pdc adoptive transfer into sick mice. The idea that few exogenous pDcs reaching the sc could confer such strong disease amalioration seemed rather puzzling. We can not rule out a possible systemic impact on immune cells in other organs following pDC transfer. We found a significant and specific increase in the expression of cmklr1 ( or chem23r ) by pdcs in the sc of pdc - transferred mice. Eae clinical and histological disease was found less severe in cmkLR1 deficient mice when compared to wt counterparts. One possibility is that under inflammatory eae condition, activated cns p dcs indeed promote disease pathogenesis. Autologous stem cell transplantations are currently tested as immunotherapy for autoimmune diseases, including ms. While tregs infused prior eae induction confer protection, their therapeutic value is considerably diminished when infused after disease initiation. manipulation of pdc numbers could be exploited in order to treat ms patients.',\n",

Based on the world bank list of middle - income countries, 10 countries are members of middle-income countries ( 96) The prevalence of hbsag in most of the african countries was higher than that observed in our meta - analysis of e and m countries. In the south - east asian regions, the values were 1.09% ( 104 ) , 1.27% ( 105 ) , and 1.7% ( 106 ) in india ; 1.4% in bangladesh ( 107 ) ; 0.53% in nepal ( 108 ) ; and 2.6% in thailand ( 109 ) , which indicate that the range of available data in these regions is somewhat comparable with the prevalence in e andm countries. The lower prevalence in iran can be attributed to the effectiveness of the screening system , the selection of The search strategy was performed with high sensitivity with all related keywords to include most of the available published studies. The large sample size of this study was another strength ; it included 28,947,262 blood donors from e and m countries. The lowest prevalence of hbsag was seen for iranian blood donors , while the highest rate was observed in djiboutian blood donors.',\n",
       " ' medicaid is now the number one payer of medical care in the united states. The recent passage and implementation of the medicare prescription drug, improvement , and modernization act ( mma ) of 2003 has contributed to public attention to these issues. This study builds on these research efforts by presenting more recent data on medicaid drug use and expenditures. The results presented in this article were obtained using two sources : ( 1) state drug utilization data files for 1994 - 2003 ( medicaid drug rebate program ) and ( 2) the master drug database of medi - span. patterns in reimbursement were compared to patterns in utilization for 2003. We also investigated the top 40 drugs in terms of reimbursements from cys 1994 -2003 , and compared their utilization , reimbursements , and mean prescription reimbursements with the remaining ( all other ) drugs. Figure 1 presents the relationship between percent changes in the mcpi and mean prescription reimbursements between cys 1994 and 2003. The top 40 drugs accounted for 34 percent of total drug reimbursements in 1994 and 43 percent in 2003. Central nervous system ( cns ) drugs had the highest total reimbursements of all groups at approximately $ 7.3 billion. Study used national medicaid data from 1994 - 2003 to investigate trends in noninstitutional drug utilization and expenditures in the medicaid program. Zyprexa and risperdal were the number one and number two medicaid drugs in terms of reimbursements in both 1998 and 2003. Drugs are now a much more prominent factor than they were a decade ago. Not one of the top 40 drugs in terms of medicaid reimbursements in 2003 was a generic. The question for policymakers will be how to ensure that beneficiaries have access to the most safe and effective drugs while ensuring that the spending on drugs is affordable. It seems likely that the increased use of generics , as a substitute for brand name drugs , when appropriate , might reduce overall drug spending in medicaid. budget pressures are forcing states to take a hard and often painful look at main cost drivers. medicaid has recently overtaken education as the number one state budget item on a national basis. Since growth in drug expenditures is one of the key drivers to overall expenditure increases in the medicaid program in recent years, states will be particularly determined to explore strategies for containing drug costs.',\n",
       " 'The association of childhood excess weight or childhood obesity with dyslipidemia was well documented. one of the main proteins involved in lipoprotein metabolism is cholesterol ester transfer protein ( cetp) cetP has atherogenic roles naturally, which function depending on the metabolic settings. thus, plasma cet p acts as an important protein in the lipid and lipop protein metabolism. Its polymorphisms may affect dyslipidsemia and cvd. The main survey included 5528 students aged 1018 years who were recruited by multistage random cluster sampling from urban and rural areas of 27 provincial counties in iran. Written informed consent was obtained from parents and oral assent from children and adolescents. For assessing lipid profile, fasting venous blood was taken and lipid profile variables including total cholesterol (tc) and triglyceride ( tg) were examined. We used the questionnaire of the world health organization - global school - based student health survey to assess physical activity. Dna was extracted using the qiaamp dna blood mini kit ( qiagen , germany ) according to the manufacturer s protocol from peripheral blood. real - time pcr and high resolution melt ( hrm ) analysis were performed in the corbett rotor - gene 6000 instrument ( corbett research pty ltd , sydney , australia ) primers were designed by beacon designer 7.91 to flank the genomic regions.

The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed a protective effect of ct / tt genotype on dyslipidemia. The g allele of a373p polymorphism increased the risk of dys Lipidemia with an or of 4.12 ( 95% ci : 2.57 - 6.62 ) in the crude and adjusted models ( table 2) Cetp= cholesterol ester transfer protein, bmi= body mass index, bw= birth weight adjusted for age, sex, physical activity, waist circumference, birth weight, socioeconomic status, healthy and unhealthy food intake. the t allele with bmi was inversely associated with dyslipidemia. Taq1b polymorphism had protective effect on dyslipidemia in iranian children and adolescents. However, a373p polymorphism was found to have adverse effect on lipids. The association of the t allele with higher hdl - c levels was observed in children. A373p polymorphism was associated with higher cetp activity and concentration, lower hdl - c levels and atherogenic effects. Effect of this snp on serum lipids is due to chance or indicates a functional effect on cetP gene expression. gene - environment interactions are common in the pathogenesis of prevalent complex disorders like dyslipidemia. lipidemia in all categories of birth weight , and the a373p polymorphism only in normal birth weight category had a significantly adverse effect. according to previous studies low birth weight correlated with higher risk for metabolic syndrome and lipid metabolism disorders in young adults. The main limitation of this study is the cross - sectional nature of the associations.',\n",
       " 'Free radicals are responsible for a lot of negative effects in organism, and their inactivation is needed. substances used in medicine should not contain free radicals, and they should be antioxidants. Free radicals may appear in drugs during sterilization processes, and such conditions accompanied by production of these paramagnetic dangerous molecules should be reject. gamma irradiation or heating of drugs ( skowroska et al . , 2012 ; kocielniak - ziemniak and pilawa , 2012 ) or herbs or herbs can kill microorganisms.  epr method is mainly used to study paramagnetic samples containing free radicals. It is also possible to test antioxidant properties of diamagnetic samples by microwave absorption. The aim of this work was to show spectroscopic examination of the influence of uv irradiation on interactions of echinaceae purpureae withFree radicals. This information was obtained by comparative analysis of epr spectra of free radicals in food, drugs and biological samples.  e. purpureae contains caffeic acid derivatives , flavonoids , polyacetylenes , polysaccharides , and small amounts of essential oil. The herb is used as a natural body tonic and shortens it the duration of colds. It is also recommended by recurrent infections of the urinary tract and inflammation of the ascending cholangitis. Epr spectra of dpph in ethyl solution after adding of the tested nonirradiated and uv - irradiated e. purpureae samples were measured. The quenching of the epr lines after addition of e. Purpureae to the solution was observed. ewidths depend on magnetic interactions in the sample. this value was used to obtain g - factor of free radicals existing in the source of free radicalsdpph. b is the magnetic induction of the field produced by electromagnet of the epr spectrometer. b  is the resonance magnetic induction epr spectrum of the reference  dpph in ethyl alcohol solution. The herb is used as a natural body tonic and shortens it the duration of colds. The infusions used in the form of lotions relieve inflammation of the throat , mouth , and gums. It supports the treatment of acne , psoriasis , eczema and herpes.  epr spectra of dpph were numerically detected as the first derivatives by the the rapid scan unit of jagmar firm ( krakw , poland ) linked with the ePR spectrometer. The total microwave power produced by klystron of the epr Spectrometer was 70  mw. Lineshape parameters of this spectrum  a1 , a2 , b1 , and b2are shown in fig . 1.  b is the magnetic induction of the field produced by electromagnet of the epr spectrometer. b   r is the resonance magnetic induction epr spectrum of the reference dpph in ethyl alcohol solution. The shape and parameters of eprSpectra changed after the addition of uv - irradiated e. purpureae for the herb exposed to electromagnetic waves during 10 and 110 min. The parameters of the epr spectra of dpph as the reference are presented in table 1. The original herb and the herb uv irradiated are shown in table 2. The magnetic induction of the field produced by electromagnet is shown in the table. Table 1 shows the analyzed parameters of the epr spectra of the reference  dpph interacting with nonirradiated and uv - irradiated e. purpureae. The times ( t ) of uv irradiation of the sample are in the range of 10110  min g - factors of 2.0036 , typical for unpaired electrons localized on nitrogen atoms. pph interacting with nonirradiated and uv - irradiated e. purpureae are compared. The total amplitudes ( a ) are also lower for the uv- irradiated samples. The parameters of lineshape of epr spectrum of dpph ( a1/a2, b1/b2 , a1    a2 , and b1 \\xa0  b2 ) changed with the time of uv irradiation.  epr spectroscopy is a physical method, which uses the epr effect ( wertz and bolton , 1986 ; weil and bolon , 2007 ) . epr Effect is caused by zeemann splitting of energy. The proposed method of examination of interactions of the herbs with free radicals has a lot of advantages. The changes of shape and amplitudes of epr. spectra of dpph in ethanol alcohol solution as the result of. interactions of e. purpureae with free Radicals were observed. The epr spectrometer measures the energy levels of electrons in magnetic fields. electrons after absorption of electromagnetic waves with the respective frequencies are excited and relax via spin  spin and spin  lattice relaxation processes. The economic costs of the epr measurements at x - band are very low because only the cold water is used to decrease the temperature of electromagnet that is needed. The interactions of e. purpureae with free radicals had a complex character. The broadening of the epr lines of dpph interacting with e. Purpureae is mainly caused by dipolar interactions between freer radicals. Nonirradiated and uv - irradiated e.Purpureae reveal antioxidant properties.  e. purpureae should be stored without exposition on uv irradiations. usefulness of electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy with paramagnetic reference of dpph to determine interactions of diamagnetic herbs with free radicals was confirmed. It decreases the antioxidative properties of this herb.',\n",
       " \"thyroid cancer accounts for 2.1% of total new cancer cases and 0.5% of cancer related death in India. The major types of follicular cell derived thyroid cancer include papillary thyroid cancer, follicular thyroid cancer ( ftc) and anaplastic thyroid cancer. It has been estimated that about forty - two million people in india suffer from thyroid diseases. Tnf- is a 17 kda cytokine identified in the late 1970s. It is primarily produced by activated macrophages , t lymphocytes , and nk cells. It can play a role in body development and immunity and in pathological responses such as inflammation, tumour growth and transplant rejection.  vcam-1 is a 90  kda glycoprotein characterized by the presence of seven immunoglobulin domains. The presence of v cam-1 has been demonstrated on endothelial cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, and surface of cancer cells. The cell - cell adhesion leads to clustering of vcam -1 and the cytoplasmic domain of this clustered vcam 1 particularly activates ezrin. This activates the pi3k / akt signaling that suppresses apoptosis and promotes survival signal in the tumour cells. 9% ( 7/76 ) patients had persistent disease and hence were not included for the disease - free survival ( dfs ) analysis. informed consent was obtained from all patients prior to sample collection and the study was approved by institutional scientific and ethical committees. The circulating levels of the tnf- , vcam-1 , and l - selectin were estimated from the serum samples using specific commercially available elisa kits. A semiquantitative immunoreactive score ( irs ) method of remmele and stegner based on staining positivity and staining intensity was implemented. The data were analyzed statistically using the statistical package for social sciences ( spss ) software version 16. The circulating levels ( mean  standard error , m  se ) of tnf- , l - selectin , and vcam- were analyzed.  circulating levels of tnf- , l - selectin , and vcam-1 were significantly higher in patients with benign thyroid diseases as compared to that in healthy individuals ( p < 0.001 for each ) Levels of tNf- and l -Selectin were found to be significantly higher. in ptc patients as compared. to those in patients in patientswith benign thyroid. diseases and ptc. The immunoreactivity of tnf- and l - selectin was found to be significantly high in ptc patients as compared to the benign thyroid disease patients. cytoplasm of the thyroid follicles was observed for l -selectin. cy toplasmic and membranous staining was also observed for vcam-1. The expression of l -Selectin was significantly positively correlated with presence of calcification. None of the two adhesion molecules exhibited a significant association with the rest of the clinicopathological parameters. A significant inverse correlation of vcam-1 expression was seen with the presence of multifocality of tumours. In univariate survival analysis, the circulating levels of none of the studied parameters could predict dfs in ptc patients. The tumoral expression of none of the studied proteins was able to predict dfs or os , in the ptc patients. High expression of vcam-1 was remarkably associated with poor dfs in female patients and in ptc. patients postoperatively treated with ria therapy and/or rt. High serum tnf- level has been associated with poor prognosis having reduced survival in prostate cancer   and epithelial ovarian cancer. High plasma tnF- concentration in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia than in healthy control population. tumoural protein expression of tNf- was not able to predict dfs or os in the ptc patients.  circulating levels of both the adhesion molecules l - selectin and vcam-1 were significantly higher in patients with the benign disease as well as ptc patients than in the healthy individuals. The absence of shedding - off of the protein overexpressed by tumour cells into the circulation may be due to stimulation of its production by the immune cells in response to tumourigenic condition.  serum l - selectin levels were closely related to disease progression in ovarian   and liver cancers. circulating vcam-1 level correlated with tumour stage in bladder cancer patients and was higher in patients with muscle invasive tumours than those with superficial tumours. in colorectal cancer , it was to be associated with dukes ' d stage and distant metastasis. Only l - selectin and not vcam-1 was significantly overexpressed in the primary tumours of thyroid cancer patients. In thyroid carcinoma the risk of disease relapse and occurrence of metastasis is relatively very low as compared to that in other malignancies arising from other organs.  vcam-1 expression has been found to be overexpressed in primary tumours of many human cancers. In the present study, v cam-1 overexpression was associated with larger tumour size, presence of lymph node metastasis and unifocal tumours. In ovarian cancer, scalici et al. showed significant increase in vcam -1 expression with advancing tumour stage. Vcam-1 expression was not able to predict dfs or os in total ptc patients. However, it was significant prognostic factors for patient survival in gastric cancer   and colorectal cancer. expression of v cam-1 in high grade serous ovarian cancer was associated with poor prognosis. There was a significant positive correlation between circulating l - selectin and tnf- in the studied pTC patients. Tnf- produced by stimulated kupffer cells appeared to promote expression of adhesion molecules early during the metastatic process. In breast cancer cell lines, vcam-1 expression was enhanced by treatment with tnf-. understanding this complexity may offer potential therapeutic targets for management of thyroid cancer which may help the clinicians to identify and perform more personalized approach.\",\n",

       " 'since the creation of the very first genome databases in 1992, data structures as well as the information content of genome databases underwent little change. To understand complex cellular processes , it is necessary to uncover the functional context of any individual gene. The development of concepts to cope with complex data structures within a database becomes practically unmanageable as soon as several independent data sources are covered. Mips genome research environment system ( genre) provides a flexible technology to cope with the needs of biological data representation. It is a j2ee based multi - tier architecture implemented with established software design patterns. seamless integration of distributed information resources ( databases and applications ) is realized with enterprise java beans ( ejbs)  simap is an object - oriented database. It is possible to query both for the nodes ( the proteins ) and the edges ( the interactions ) of the graph. This traversal can be used to quickly scan the network for false - positive interactions between proteins whose functions and/or localizations differ completely or to assign new functions to proteins. Cabinet offers a set of methods for network statistics, integration, analysis and clustering applied to interaction data administered by genre as well as to user - submitted network data. cabinet allows the user to browse and query across any subset of the generated networks and clusters. Software design of cabinet allows an easy adoption of new functions into the system. The mips data resource aims to extend the scope of its curated genome databases towards functional context information.

       " 'Central giant cell granulomas ( cgcg) occur in individuals less then 30 years of age with definite female predeliction. radiographically it presents usually as multilocular , expansile radiolucency displacing the teeth. sometimes causing root resorption and cortical perforation. The conservative treatment approach includes intralesional calcitonin , intralsional steroids , antiangiogenic therapy , and radiotherapy. On palpation the swelling was bony hard , nontender , not compressible , and not reducible. differential diagnosis considered were radicular cyst , calcifying epithelial odontogenic cyst, adenomatoids tumor, fibrous dysplasia, desmoplastic ameloblastoma , and central giant cell granuloma. The case involved the entire alveolar bone in between 21 and 23 ( 22 was missing ) , extending from the medial aspect of 23 to the mid - palatine suture. The associated teeth were endodontically treated and tilted toward each other occlusanally with no evidence of external root resorption. These radiological features ruled out the possibility of fibrous dysplasia , calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor , and desmoplastic ameloblastoma.  conducted a 10-year review of occurance and treatment of cgcg and reported various presentations of the lesion such as pain, swelling, paresthesia, asymmetry and periapical pathology. The unusual case of cGCg in the anterior maxilla associated with the congenitally missing tooth shows us yet another unique way in which these lesions may present in oral cavity. therefore, it also suggests that cgcG should be considered in the differential diagnosis of swellings of jaws.',\n",
       " \"adrenal hemorrhage presenting with huge retroperitoneal tumors is rare , with few published reports in the literature ( 1 ) . in addition , surgical treatment is selected for most cases ; therefore, reports of the course of conservative treatment tracked by computed tomography ( ct ) images are few. We herein report a case presenting with a huge left retro peritoneal mass that was later complicated with idiopathic unilateral adrenal hemorrhages. The course of treatment was followed by a series of ct images. We suspected the presence of intraperitoneal hemorrhage but also considered the possibility of acute pancreatitis because of his drinking history. The right adrenal gland had normal morphology on coronal sections on the 3rd day of illness. magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealed no abnormalities in the pancreatic or bile ducts. The patient was admitted to hospital with abdominal pain on the 6th and 9th day of illness. He was discharged on the 18th day after a non-surgical follow-up examination. No subsequent anemia progression was observed and the patient 's abdominal pain improved. Re-testing performed approximately two months later revealed that all of the adrenal hormones had normalized. A ct scan taken approximately 1 year after hospitalization revealed a mildly swollen left adrenal gland with post - hemorrhage scarring continuing from it. adrenal hemorrhage is rare and thought to be most commonly caused by external injury. Other reported causes include adrenal cancer, metastatic tumor, adrenal cyst, pheochromocytoma and hemorrhagic diathesis. The hematoma scar continued from a somewhat swollen left adrenal gland and had a cystoid shape. Because no clear blood vessel or coagulation abnormalities were noted , no vessel abnormality such as aneurysm was suspected. It was impossible to exclude the presence of an adrenal tumor as the source of bleeding and a potential re - bleeding problem.\",\n",
       " 'This literature review analyses articles on the use of prp in tendinous healing ( experimental and clinical studies ) published between 1 january 2012 and 31 december 2014. The results of both pre - clinical and Clinical studies were analyzed separately in this review and finally discussed together in order to trying to improve this therapeutic modality. Different prps stimulate cell proliferation ( muscle, bone and tendon) in different ways. The most concentrated prps and those containing white blood cells are less efficient than less concentrated prp and strongly concentratedPrps without white blood cell. The anti - bacterial effect of prp against staphylococcus aureus was not linked to the presence ofwhite blood cells. Prp does not enable the reversal of degenerative tendinopathies. It does enable the differentiation of tenocyte stem cells and inhibits the differentiation in adipocytes, chondrocytes and osteocytes. Local anaesthetics which may be used as painkillers during prp infiltration in clinical practice could compromise the potential therapeutic potential of platelets. Prps are used in the context of chronic tendinopathies in injectable form. The aim is to reduce the duration of functional impotence and to encourage an early return to physical activity. Currently the use of these prps remains a topic of debate and even controversy. table 1 presents the clinical studies discussed in this review. A study of 26 patients who had suffered from lateral epicondylitis for more than six months and who had received prp infiltration. ultrasound observations showed the fissure had disappeared in 65% of patients , as well as a reduction in the pathological area and doppler hyperaemia in 27% of subjects. The randomised , controlled , double - blind study ( level 1 ) by krogh et al . , did not show any difference after prp , corticoid or physiological liquid infiltration in the context of epicONDylitis. After the first intervention however , after the second infiltration of prp , a clinical improvement ( in pain and mobility of the shoulder ) was observed in comparison with the control group. After four weeks, the patients were able to gradually restart their sporting or recreational activities. After six months, a 23-year old elite athlete ( level 4) who had received multidisciplinary treatment including prp infiltration for patellar tendinopathy. After six and twelve months of follow up , the prp patients presented better progress than the group treated with shock waves. The beneficial effect dissipates over time and at 26 weeks no difference could be seen between the two groups. Three patients who had already received prp infiltration for unresponsive patellar tendinopathy experienced an increase in painful symptoms leading to an inability to take part in sport. Studies on the use of prp for patellar tendinopathies currently appear to be favourable , but high standard of proof studies remain fairly contradictory. by releasing different platelet growth factors , prps are a new treatment for chronic tendinopathy. The ease of use , the relatively low cost , and the low invasive nature of the treatment are complementary arguments. The effectiveness of prp on tissue regeneration in vitro and in animals is not yet known. Prps are injected into the tendinous lesion, possibly guided by ultrasound ( under aseptic conditions ) to improve the accuracy of this treatment. The optimal concentration of platelets used in the treatment of tendinous lesions has not yet been validated. The ioc coordinated the drafting of three articles on prp confirming the medical - sporting value of this treatment. It recommends that the injection is guided by ultrasound in order to ensure the correct position of the needle. A few minutes after infiltration , prps diffuse beyond the infiltrated area and the lesion site.',\n",

Rickettsiae and rickettsial antigens in sections of heart, spleen , and kidney were localized within and around vascular endothelial cells and reticuloendothelial cells. A single serum sample, collected on the ninth day of illness , demonstrated neither immunoglobulin ( ig ) g nor igm antibodies reactive with r. conorii when tested by an indirect immunofluorescence antibody assay at a screening dilution of 1:16. To further define the causative agent , we attempted to amplify a portion of the ricketsial rompa gene using dna extracted from the paraffin - embedded sections of the heart , spleen, and kidneys.  immunostaining demonstrated an sfg rickettsial infection as the cause of the patient s death. Yet , because the ihc assay reacts with several species of sfg Rickettsiae, a specific etiologic agent was not determined. serologic evaluation of a serum specimen. obtained late in the course of this patient s illness failed to demonstrate antibody reactive with sfg. RICKettsiosis are an underreported and underappreciated cause of illness in sub - saharan africa. Rickettsial infections in central and sub - saharan africa have been reported among tourists and travelers who visited game reserves. The prevalence of spotted fever in local populations may be obscured by the lack of obvious rash and the overwhelming number of cases of malaria.

       " \"Diabetes mellitus has long been considered a disease of carbohydrate metabolism. before the discovery of insulin in 1921, low carbohydrate starvation diets were the default treatment. The pendulum has again swung the other way and there is renewed interest in very low carbohydrate diets for the treatment of diabetes. The evidence available is contradictory at best , and leaves both health professionals and people with diabetes alike wondering if low carb diets live up to the hype surrounding them. In practice, most atkins - style diets are designed to be very low in carbohydrate ( less than 20 g / day initially ) and high in protein and fat. A recent systematic review and meta - analysis suggested that low carbohydrate , low glycemic index ( gi ) , mediterranean , and high protein diets all showed greater improvements in glycemic control than control diets. Low carbohydrate diets are not necessarily superior in effect. The aim of the study was to show that improvements in glycemic control , cvd risk , and weight loss are achievable with different diets with varying amounts of carbohydrate.

This review of recent studies evaluating the effects of low carbohydrate diets in people with type  2 diabetes supports previous meta - analyses. Although there may be greater short - term improvements in glycemic control , weight loss , and cvd risk , this is not sustained over the longer - term. Much of the positive effect of low carb diets is due to weight loss, and the effect independent of weight change is difficult to assess. The look ahead trial ( clinicaltrials.gov identifier , nct0017953 ) reported greater weight loss. , glycemic control , and cvd risk factors ( although not cvd mortality ) . low carbohydrate diets were associated with a significantly higher risk of all - cause mortality. reductions in carbohydrate intake may also be associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia in those treated with insulin. Low carbohydrate diets may increase the risk of cvd as they are associated with higher total and saturated fat intakes. There is little evidence for this in people with type  2 diabetes as there are very few studies. The long - term effects of low carbohydrate diets on calcium metabolism and bone health are unknown. There is little evidence to support changing current recommendations for fat intake in people with type  2 diabetes. There is a further consideration that is now coming to the fore , and that is the challenge of sustainable nutrition. sustainable diets are nutritionally adequate, safe, affordable , and culturally acceptable.  low carbohydrate diets tend to be higher in protein , and this may have an adverse effect on renal function. there is very little research in this field , and none at all in people with diabetes , making it challenging to draw firm conclusions. The most controversial aspect of low carbohydrate diet is that they may increase the risk of cvd as they are associated with higher saturated fat intakes. There is little evidence to support changing current recommendations for fat intake in people with type  2 diabetes. There are no significant differences between low fat , high carbohydrate diets and low carbohydrate diets for primary prevention of cvd. sustainable diets are nutritionally adequate, safe, affordable , and culturally acceptable and are sparing of natural and human resources. Evidence suggests that low carbohydrate diets are effective for weight loss and improvements in glycemic control and cvd risk. Long - term side effects of these diets remain unknown. Diabetes uk and the american diabetes association recommend an individualized approach where health professionals work with the person with diabetes to identify an eating pattern.  any medium , provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source.

       " 'behavioral deficits , particularly of cognitive nature such as impairments in learning and memory, are common in patients following surgery under general anesthesia. The causes of postoperative cognitive dysfunction are unclear, but animal studies indicate that general anesthesia alone can produce lasting cognitive deficits. fear conditioning , which is primarily mediated by the amygdala, is impaired after general anesthesia, in rats   and mice. Experiments were performed using 10-week - old male sprague dawley rats. Animals were pair housed in an environmentally controlled room. anesthesia was induced using 35% isoflurane ( baxter , deerfield , il ) at a fresh gas flow of 57  l / min. Rats were anesthetized with 35% isoflurane and rapidly decapitated. Coronal slices ( 400  m) were cut using a vibratome. Field potentials were evoked in the bla by stimulation of the external capsule. signals were digitized using the pclamp 10.4 software.  whole - cell recordings were obtained from principal neurons in the bla. neurons were visualized with an infrared light , through a 40x water immersion objective with a ccd-100 camera affixed. spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents ( sipscs) were recorded in the presence of kynurenic acid. ionic currents were amplified and filtered ( 1  khz ) using the axopatch 200b amplifier.  field potentials evoked by stimulation of the external capsule were recorded in the bla. slices obtained from control rats and rats who had been exposed to isoflurane. stimulus intensity was adjusted to evoke a response of 65 to 75% of the maximum response amplitude. magnitude of ltp was determined by averaging the amplitude of the evoked responses at 50 to 60  min after hfs and expressing it as a percentage of the baseline amplitude. Gabaergic inhibition can suppress the induction and expression of ltp. We examined whether the impaired synaptic plasticity in the bla after repeated exposures to isoflurane was associated with alterations in spontaneous inhibitory activity. Whole - cell recordings were obtained from bla principal neurons in the presence of 1.5  mm kynurenic acid. One month after the repeated exposures, the charge transfer ( 102  8 pc , n = 16 ) had returned to control levels. The frequency of sipscs was also significantly increased from 8.6  1.2  hz ( n = 13 ) in the control group to 27.5 1.5 hz in the study group.  repeated exposures to isoflurane produce a long - term increase of spontaneous gabaa receptor - mediated synaptic transmission. The increased inhibitory activity in the bla network may have prevented sufficient postsynaptic depolarization and ca influx for ltp induction. The failure of hfs to induce ltp at 1 day and 1 week after repeated exposures could be due , at least in part , to the enhanced basal gabaergic inhibitoryactivity. The bla is a key part of the brain circuit involved in fear - related learning and fear conditioning. impaired fear conditioning after isoflurane exposure has been observed in adult mice   and rats. The enhanced basal gabaergic inhibition in the bla may also have other functional consequences. The amygdala plays a central role in assigning emotional value.  repeated exposures to isoflurane can alter the physiology of the bla. Such alterations may translate into deficits in processing the emotional components of sensory experiences. behavioral disorders if anesthesia / surgery takes place in early childhood. symptoms indicative of depression have been reported in healthy young men.',\n",
       " 'idiopathic ( primary ) hyperhidrosis is defined as excessive sweating with no clear cause. excessive palmoplantar , axillae , facial , or cervical region sweating usually occurs bilaterally. It causes social, psychological, emotional , and  professional difficulties for the afflicted. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of our local tap water in conjunction with  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 iontophoresis in the treatment of idiopathic hyperhidrosis. The patient had almost all of the above mentioned features with the sweating first occurring at 8 years old. She had received no treatment for at least one year before the study. The subject was asked to place her right palm in 400 ml tap water within a fiberglass tub with the dimensions of 15  24  cm. The left palm was placed in normal saline. The right and left palms were in contact with rubber pads ( 4.5  3.5 cm ) that were connected to the negative and positive electrodes. The pads were connected with a direct current ( dc ) stimulator. dc was used for the conventional iontophoresis treatment as dc causes fewer adverse reactions ( such as pain, skin burning , itching , and irritation ) than alternating current ( ac ) We showed the efficacy of our local tap water and normal saline iontophoresis treatment for idiopathic hyperhidrosis. In contrast to some findings11 , the efficacy was greater than that of tap water. The exact mechanism behind this improvement is not known. For instance, pore obstruction of sweat ducts secondary to hyperkeratinization , impairment of the electrochemical gradient of sweat , and biofeedback mechanism may be responsible.  decreased sweat on the soles of our case may be associated with a biofeedback mechanism which needs further investigation. in our area , the tap water is said to be hard which may have adversely affected the efficacy of the treatment compared with normal saline. However, normal saline is considered a standard liquid with almost similar efficacy in the literature. equipment settings and methodology might have affected the effectiveness of iontophoresis.',\n",
       " 'a nanotechnology has provided the methods by which the limitations in the industrial application of each scientific technology could be overcome. products manufactured using nanomaterials are characterized to overcome the areas which can not be resolved with the previous technology. There is an increasing concern that they would be new hazardous factors for both humans and nature. until the year of 2006, 69% of total manuscripts published on a peer - reviewed journal are related to the toxicity. Nanomaterials are crystalline , fine particles with a large surface area. They are absorbed into the body and then induce the biological toxicity ( 5,6 ) by various routes such as an inhalation. It has been proposed that the contactable nanoparticles might stimulate the immune system in the body. Carbon black induces the immune responses. Multi - walled carbon nanotubes ( mwcnt ) induce the activation of immune responses to a greater extent. iron oxide nanoparticles strongly induce the immune response. gold nanoparticles induce a moderate degree of the immune responding. silica , polystyrene and latex nanomaterials have an immunotoxicity. No studies have provided the possibility that carbon nanotubes , nano - fibers and nano - wire products might induce the detrimentalness to such an equivalent extent to asbestos. nanoparticles contained in particulate matter are known as a strong inducer of oxidative stress in macrophages and epithelial cells lining the airway tract. -5 and eotaxin which was induced in the early stage of inflammation. subsequently , with the induced expression of such cytokines as il-13 , rantes and mcp-1 , the degree of inflammation was further increased. Based on the reports that tio2 which has frequently been used for cosmetic products aggravates the atopic dermatitis , it has been proposed that nanoparticles might aggravate the immune diseases.',\n",
       " 'congenital pulmonary lymphangiectasis ( cpl ) is a poorly documented disease. cpl is a uniformly fatal developmental defect that is related to an apparent failure of the communication between the pulmonary lymphatics and the systemic lymph channels. The primary form presents in neonates , and the patients mostly die due to the respiratory distress shortly after birth. A one - day - old male neonate was admitted to the department of pediatrics due to cyanosis, moaning sound, and poor activity since birth. cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed , but he expired on the same day. At autopsy , external examination revealed multiple needle marks on both extremities and two incision lines at the lateral chest for the closed thoracostomy. The heart measured 43.52.2 cm and the external contour was sweet potato - like appearance. ous parents , suddenly died at the age of 13 days without any significant symptoms or signs while changing the diapers. external examination revealed no specific abnormalities except several needle marks on the extremities and feces on the buttock area. after en bloc dissection of the thoracic organs , the lymphatic channels of paravertebral area were congested by lymphatic fluids. under light microscopy , there was widespread ectasia of lymphatics in the pleura and in the interlobular septa. Pulmonary lymphangiectasis is a congenital disorder of the lymphatic system. lymphatic channels are found throughout the human body and facilitate the transport of excess interstitial fluids from all tissues back into the cardiovascular system. interference with the normal lymphatic passage results in excessive interstitial fluid accumulation, known as lymphedema. iectasis without the presence of abnormalities in the cardiovascular system. cpl probably results from a failure of pulmonary interstitial connective tissues to regress , leading to the dilation of pulmonary lymphatic capillaries. It usually occurs after the 16th week of fetal life. The secondary form can occur when surgery, radiation, infection, tumor , or trauma disturbs effective lymphatic drainage. olar walls by collagen , fibroblasts , and some inflammatory cells. Since such interstitial nonspecific changes can be seen in normal lungs or other case reports of cpl ( 1 , 7 , 8) , it can easily be differentiated from other interstitial lung disease , such as interstitial pneumonia. It is occasionally difficult to differentiate pulmonary lymphangiectasis from lymphangiomatosis by histological examination because both conditions have similar clinical manifestations.  secondary lymphangiectasis presents as localized or diffuse pulmonary interstitial infiltrates or cystic lesions on chest radiography and magnetic resonance imaging. dilated lymphatics lead to life - threatening pulmonary hypoplasia and respiratory failure. many patients with cpl die at their neonatal period or infantile period , as shown in these cases.',\n",

Hepatitis a viral infection is a wide spread infection throughout the world. In the developing countries, hepatitis 92% to 100% of the 18-year - old people have serologic evidence of past infection. infants and toddlers are more likely to be asymptomatic ( anicteric hepatitis ) , whereas the majority of adults will develop clinically evident hepatitis.  gallbladder hydrops due to hepatitis a viral infection is uncommon and is exceptionally described in the literature. kawasaki syndrome, mesenteric adenitis with pressure over cystic duct, streptococcal and staphylococcal infections with the associated toxin production had reported association with hydrops.

The go / nogo task is a well - established measure of inhibition with adequate psychometric properties. We used a computerized , modified version of the shape school ( smidts and groot 2005 ) Children were asked to respond using response buttons ( see procedure for details regarding the response buttons ) Children responded by pressing either the red or yellow button , depending on the color of the figure and the rule accompanying the condition. Three conditions were administered : the control, inhibition , and switching condition. In this study, children were asked to name as many examples from two specific categories : \" animals \" and \" things you can eat or drink \" within a 40-second time frame. The total number of correct words across both categories was used as an index for verbal fluency. Response time for each condition for the total of 16 cards was recorded manually. There were two practice trials where the child was asked to sort four cards depicting two different disney figures. These cards did not show identical images that needed to be matched. The child was required to sort the cards according to color, size or function. After a correct sort, the examiner mixed up the cards and asked the child to make two groups again. This procedure was repeated until the child had correctly sorted the cards. The child was shown six cards, which could be sorted according to either color or size. The child received one point for each correct sort. If the child did not understand task instructions when first presented with the six cards , one dimension was removed. The total raw score was calculated by summing all the points earned and was used as an indication of childrens ability to shift between concepts. Group differences for the ef task dependent variables were analyzed with group ( very preterm versus control ) as the between subjects factor. chi - square statistics were carried out to determine if there were group differences in rates of ef impairments. analyses were run while controlling for mean rt on the control condition of each specific task. Study group consisted of 50 children born very preterm ( i.e. gestational age 30  weeks , established by weeks and days after the mother s last menstrual period ) and 50 controls.

The shape school is a storybook for preschoolers designed to measure inhibition and switching processes. We used a computerized version of the shape school task. children were asked to respond using response buttons. The total number of correct responses and efficiency of responding was used as an index of inhibition. efficiency measures comprise both accuracy and response time. The day - night task is a well - validated measure of prepotent response inhibition in young children. Children were shown a set of 16 cards with pictures of either a sun or a moon with stars. There were two conditions : ( 1) a control condition, in which the child had to say \" day \" in response to a sun card and \" night \" inresponse to a moon card. ( 2) an experimental condition, where the child was asked to respond to the sun card by saying \" night\" and vice versa. Response time for each condition for the total of 16 Cards was recorded manually using a stopwatch. There were three conditions characterized by three increasing levels of structure in terms of help supplied by the examiner. The dependent variables used in this study were the total number of correctly recalled strings in the forward and backward condition, of which the latter served as an index for working memory. The child had to repeat at least one string correctly in order to proceed to the next trial. The child was shown six cards and asked to sort them according to color, size or function. If the child was unable to sort the cards according to one of the three groupings, the examiner mixed them up and asked the child to sort again. The child received one point for each correct sort. The total raw score was calculated by summing all the points earned and was used as an indication of childrens ability to shift between concepts. Computerized tasks were administered using the e - prime software package ( psychology software tools , pittsburgh , pa ) and a dell latitude d800 laptop with a 15.4-inch color screen. Children responded by making a button press with one hand , but were required to keep both hands placed on top of the buttons so that they could react as quickly as possible. The children were examined individually in a quiet room while one of their parents was present. Group differences in performance on the go / nogo task and the shape school inhibition and switching conditions were reanalyzed. The threshold for significance was set at p  <  0.05 ( two - sided ) for all analyses. missing data and extreme values missing data resulted from either examiner error or child noncompliance and was less than 4% for each of the dependent variables. All children met the performance criteria for continuing on to the experimental trials during the practice phases of the go / gono task and the shape school task.

We reanalyzed group differences for efficiency on the go / nogo task and vf task. Group differences for efficiency were adjusted for mean rt on the day - night task control condition. strong, nearly large ( cohen 1992) correlation coefficients were found for word span backwards. maternal education explained 12% of the variance in efficiency on the shape school inhibition condition. gender was not associated with any of the ef dependent variables. The impact of demographic and neonatal risk factors on ef was not significant. ational age, entered in the second block, explained 12% of the variance. The nbrs total score did not predict performance on any of the ef measures. Very preterm children demonstrated poorer inhibitory control than the controls on the go / nogo task and the day - night task. The very preterm group obtained a mean iq within the average range , which however was significantly lower than themean iq of the control group. iq is suggested to mostly influence more complex functions that require a greater degree of conceptual problem - solving ability. We found that gender was not associated with ef . although some studies with normally developing children found gender differences in performance on ef tasks. The degree of neonatal illness was not associated with poor performance on the ef tasks. This finding suggests a modest role for stimulating environmental aspects to improve ef. More specific environmental factors, such as family functioning and parenting style, might even have a greater contribution. The use of experimental measures tapping into a comprehensive range of ef abilities helps to chart the nature of the neurocognitive difficulties in very preterm children. Our findings add to the relatively small but rapidly growing literature on early school - aged very preterm children. The ef deficits observed may have important implications for their later academic and behavioral functioning. Future studies should be conducted to cast more light on how eF deficits in these children are related to white and grey matter pathology.',\n",
       " 'Rcc accounts for approximately 3% of all adult neoplasms and in about 30% of patients it has a tendency to metastasize. breast metastases from extra - mammary tumors are much less common with respecto to primary breast tumors. We report a case of rcc metastasis to the breast occurring 9 years after primary surgery for rcc. The difficulties in obtaining a correct diagnosis , which is crucial to avoid unnecessary mastectomy are discussed. The breast is a rare site of metastatic deposits , as emerges from the small number of cases reported in the literature. However, it is possible that the incidence of such finding will become more and more frequent because of the increasing number of patients who live longer bearing malignant disease. The 5-year and 10-year survival rates for the patients with rcc treated with nephrectomy are 95% and 91% for pt1 and pt2.  metastatic lesions in the breast present as painless and mobile discrete masses with rapid growth. No strong evidence of a significant prognostic difference between metachronous and synchronous presentations. Malignant extension to the breast can be explained by the spread of neoplastic cells from the renal vein into the inferior vena cava. A micro - histological biopsy of any new breast lesion appearing in a patient with a history of treatment for rcc as mandatory. A whole body ct scan may be included in the staging work - up. Metastasectomy is the treatment of choice. axillary lymph nodes should be removed only in cases of overt metastatic deposists.',\n",
       " 'Pituitary adenomas are clinically classified as functional ( 70% ; such as acromegaly and prolactinoma ) and nonfunctional ( 30% ) They cause significant morbidity through a compression of regional structures and an inappropriate expression of pituitary hormones. An early - stage diagnosis of nf pituitaries is difficult because there is no hormone hypersecretion and no effective chemical therapy. Mixed - tumors ( co - secrete gh with prl , tsh , or acth ) might also arise from single cells. acth oversecretion results in cushing s disease , with features of hypercortisolism. gh hypersecretion leads to acral overgrowth and metabolic dysfunction associated with acromegaly. prl oversecrete leads to gonadal failure , secondary infertility , and galactorrhea. more rarely, tsh hypersecretions leads to hyperthyroxinemia and goiter. hypersecreted gh ( or gh subunits ) leads to Gonadal dysfunction. The pituitary is the most - protected organ in the body , and is the master regulatory gland. Several different hypothalamic-pituitary - target organ axes exist. Based on the new concept of prediction , prevention , and personalized patient treatment of an nf pituitsary adenoma, the proteome must be analyzed. The proteome dynamic changes with tumor progression. An nf pituitary adenoma is monoclonal in origin , and is generally benign. control post - mortem Pituitary tissues contain different types of cells, including at least corticotrophs. The use of laser - capture microdissection to preferentially enrich a specific tumor cell type from tumor tissues overcomes this bias. The amino acid sequence of a protein in each 2d gel spot is obtained with ms. Tumors and control samples are labeled with different fluorescent dyes. The mixed sample is separated with 2dge according to pi and mr. The amino acid sequence of tryptic peptides from each protein in each gel spot is determined with ms / ms. 2d dige is more useful to analyze precious lcm - enriched samples.  pathway analysis has been used to mine significant pathway networks from pituitary adenoma tissue comparative proteomic data and proteomic modification data. The recovery of the tumor - altered pathway system to the normal pathway system would contribute significantly to interventional prevention and effective chemical therapy. A tissue proteome is a systematic and tightly regulated protein - network system that dynamically changes.

The oxidative stress - antioxidative stress - response system could be the novel target to develop effective therapeutic agents that could be used for human pituitary adenomas. Any decrease in the capability of this antioxidant protective system could increase the susceptibility to oxidative stress, tumor inflammation, carcinogen toxicity, and tumorigenesis.  mapk pathways are emerging as potential therapeutic targets for cancer. The development of inhibitors of mapk pathway has a growing importance in cancer therapy. The pka type i beta regulatory subunit is nitrated in human pituitary adenomas. Those nitrations could interfere with dimerization and affect pka activity to suppress raf activity.  gh - pituitary adenoma correlate with a poor clinical response to somatostatin analog therapy because rkip can bind to and inhibit raf1 kinase to attenuate mapk signaling. Those altered crucial elements in the nf pituitaries tissue proteomic network system could have three main uses: (i) the accurate molecular classification of nf adenomas, (ii) interventional prevention of the disease, and (iii) improved patient healthcare. Proteomics can identify the crucial protein elements unique to an nf pituitary adenoma in the proteome - network systems. High - risk population that will be identified with body fluid ( serum ; csf ) biomarkers will benefit from those drugs to recover their proteome to the normal status. Multiple - parameter pattern - diagnostic markers and assessment indices of prevention and therapy response will replace the single - parameter biomarker for the prediction, prevention , and personalized treatment of nf pituitary adenomas. csf and blood serum / plasma are excellent targets to develop early - stage diagnostic markers , and to develop the assessment indices.  surface - enhanced laser desorption / ionization time - of - flight mass spectrometry ( seldi - tof - ms ) has been used in this protein - pattern recognition. serum or csf samples from tumor and controls were individually applied to a seldI chip. The retained proteins on the chip were subsequently ionized ( maldi ) and detected with tof- ms.  developed a signature serum - peptide pattern to predict metastatic thyroid carcinomas. csf protein pattern and peptide patterns are also under development to diagnose cns system disease with a similar strategy. pattern - recognition method would have more potential in combination with other genetic factor analysis , and with amino acid sequence data. The traditional assessment of the level of one serum - hormone is difficult to detect clinical nf pituitary adenomas. The global - proteomic strategy offers the promise for the multiple - parameter assessment for the predictive diagnosis and the measurement of preventive and therapeutic response. A tumor - tissue proteomic - variation study would lead to an accurate molecular classification of an nf adenoma. Proteomic variations offer numerous opportunities to predict , prevent , and provide a personalized treatment ( pppm) for nf pituitary adenomas. The detection and modalities of proteomic variation will serve an effective role in the prediction , prevention , and personalized treatment of nf Pituitary Adenoma patients.  of the high - risk population and an accurate assessment of preventive and therapeutic responses. of theHigh risk population.

       " \"diabetic retinopathy ( dr) is the leading cause of vision loss in working - age adults. There were estimated to be just over 13.5 million individuals afflicted with diabetes mellitus ( dm ) in the usa in 2002. Estimates indicate that the incidences of dm and dr are both significantly increasing with as many as 50 million or more individuals with dm by 2050. Dme is the major etiology of visual impairment or loss with approximately 900,000 individuals with active dme in the usa. dme is due to extracellular swelling typically in henle 's layer of the macula caused by breakdown of the blood - retinal barriers. The retinal vasculature of individuals with dme contains an increased density of leukocytes. This coincides with an increase in expression of icam-1 ( intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ) This leads to proinflammatory changes and increased vascular permeability due to damage of vascular endothelial cells. These changes lead to further breakdown of the blood - retinal barrier. Il-8 levels are not affected by the administration of intravitreal anti - vegf or corticosteroid agents. individuals with a longer history of dm are at higher risk of developing dme. optimal hypertensive and dm control can delay and even prevent the onset of dme and vision loss.  intensive glycemic control was associated with a 25% decrease in microvascular complications and a reduction in the need for macular laser photocoagulation. until the early 1980s , there was no intervention available for the treatment of dme. A landmark prospective randomized study performed by the early treatment diabetic retinopathy study ( etdrs ) group found that grid macular photocoaggulation decreased the risk of moderate to severe vision loss from dme by 50% compared to untreated controls over 3 years.  intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide has been used for the treatment of dme for a number of years. The effects are often short - lived , requiring frequent retreatment with the main side effects being cataract and glaucoma. In eyes with dme, use of both 2  mg and 4 mg doses resulted in over 50% of eyes gaining 10 etdrs letters.  retisert is fda approved for use in chronic , noninfectious uveitis. The incidence of elevated intraocular pressure and cataract formation was much higher in eyes receiving the implant. 33.8% requiring incisional glaucoma surgery and 91% requiring cataracts extraction.  dme found that a 700  g dose resulted in va gains of 10 etdrs letters at 90 days after implantation in 33.3% of eyes. vegf - a is believed to be one of the major mediating factors associated with the development of dr and dme. pegaptanib , a pegylated aptamer that targets the vegF-165 isoform, was found to be more efficacious than macular laser at 24 months.  ranibizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody fragment that binds all isoforms of vegf - a. pegaptanib is fda approved for the treatment of neovascular age - related macular degeneration ( amd) and is widely used for this indication. intravitreal pharmacotherapy has replaced macular laser photocoagulation as the gold standard. The burden of monthly intravitreal injections can become quite an encumbrance for patients, physicians , and the healthcare system as a whole. This has prompted studies to evaluate if combination therapies can be more efficacious than either treatment alone or if combination therapy allows for fewer treatments while maintaining va gains. A large prospective study conducted by the diabetic retinopathy clinical research network ( drcr) sought to answer this specific question. A single intravitreal injection of 0.7  mg dexamethasone ( ozurdex ) in previously vitrectomized eyes with persistent dme demonstrated a va gain of 6 etdrs letters at week 8. The optimal timing of when to initiate treatment needs to be further elucidated. macular laser photocoagulation still has a role in dme , particularly fdme. cinolone acetonide followed by focal macular laser 2 weeks later in eyes with intractable ddme. va gains of approximately 10 etdrs letters were realized in both groups 1 year after treatment. induction of a posterior vitreous detachment ( pvd ) ocriplasmin ( jetrea ; thrombogenics , belgium ) has been approved by the fda for the treatment of vitreomacular adhesion and has some efficacy in inducing a pvd.\",\n",
       " 'The bed nucleus of stria terminalis ( bst) is a limbic forebrain structure that concentrate estrogen and aromatase enzyme. The bst is known to be influenced by circulating gonadal hormones altering immunoreactivity of the neuropeptides vasopressin , substance p , and cholecystokinin. We studied ovariectomized ( ovx ) and ovx estrogen treated ( Ovx+e ) anesthetized rats to assess the. effect of circulatory estrogen on cardiovascular responses of the bst. We also assessed the effect of reversible ablation of the rvlm on the bSt cardiovascular responses. The experiments were designed for studying the neuronal connectivity between bst and rvlm in relation to cardiovascular responses. The experiments were done on different groups of ovx and ovx+e female rats, as follows : -microinjection of saline into the bst ( the control group [ n=6 ] -microInjections of glutamate ( glu ) into thebst and thervlm were 20 and 50 nl. microinjection of l - glutamate into the bst ( 0.25 m/20 nl ; sigma , ovx [ n=24 ] , 81 injections ; and ovx+e [ n =23 ] , 76 injections ) . -to find the neuronal connectivity between the b st and the rvlm. -to investigate the effect of inhibition of gabaa receptors of the rlm on cardiovascular responses of the bSt. Frozen serial transverse sections ( 50 m ) of the regions of the bst and rvlm were cut and stained with neutral red ( merk , germany ) The injection sites were determined according to a rat brain atlas under the light microscope ( nikon , japan ) ( figures 1 and 2 ) schematic coronal sections of rat brain adopted from an atlas,23 show the injection sites of cobalt chloride (  ) , bicuculline (  ), and phaclophen ( o ) into the rvlM. cardiovascular responses of regional controls   in the anaesthetized female ovx and ovx+e rats were compared between the saline and vehicle groups using independent t test  glutamate was first injected into the bst of the ovx and ovx+e rats. The depressor and bradycardic responses were similar in the magnitude in the pervious experiments ( ovx : map : -23.85.97 mmhg and hr : -10.02.5 bpm ; ovx +e : map: -25.50.3 mmhG and hr ; -12.60.5bpm) Glutamate was then microinjected into thebst ( 0.25 m/20 nl) to determine the effect of glutamate on the map and hr. Microinjection of cocl2 into the rvlm of ovx and ovx+e rats had no significant effect on the baseline values of map and hr compared with the pre - injection values. re - stimulation of the bst , 10 minutes after microinjection. of cocL2, significantly attenuated the depressor and bradycardic responses of the same site of the. bst. The magnitude of depressor response during stimulation of bst 10. minutes after cocl1 was injected was significantly different from the pre. injection values ( ovx : map : -6.32.1 mmhg and hr : -2.52.5 bpm [ p<0.01 ] ; ov To test the possible inhibition of cardiovascular responses of the bst by gabaergic neurons of the rvlm, first glutamate was injected into the bSt of the ovx and ovx+e rats, then a gabaa antagonist bicuculline was injected. 10 minutes later, the depressor and bradycardic responses were reduced to almost 50% of their control value. 60 min after the microinjection of bicUCulline into the rflm, the magnitude of depressor responses by re - stimulation of thebst approximately returned to their Control value. Microinjection of glutamate into the bst elicited bradycardic and depressor responses ( ovx : map : -26.13.0 mmhg and hr : -16.93.1 bpm ; ovx+e: map : 6.91.4 mmhG and hr: 8.73.2 bpm ) to find the possible effects of gabab receptors of the rvlm on the cardiovascular responses. phaclophen was microinjected into the rtlm of the ovx and ovx-e rats. No significant difference was found in both map and hr compared with their pre - injection values. We found that estrogen decreased hr significantly. circulatory estrogen did not alter the cardiovascular depressor response evoked by bst stimulation. Rvlm neurons in the medulla mediated the bst cardiovascular responses. circulating estrogen within the physiological range affects hr. The role of estrogen in the protection of the heart from ischemic heart disease has recently been suggested. ic responses in ovx and ovx+e rats were similar , suggesting that the circulatory level of estrogen did not affect the bst cardiovascular responses. The bst contains a high density of estrogen receptors that affect some physiological functions such as sexual behavior, social affiliation, sexual dimorphism and masculinization of bst neurons. For the first time , our study showed that the decrease in map and hr in response to bst stimulation was partly mediated by a pathway from bst to rvlm. The rvlm is a critical site in the tonic and reflex control of blood pressure and monosynaptically connected to sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord. The spinal cord mediates the sympathetic effect of the forebrain and brain stem nuclei to vasculature and heart. We demonstrated that circulatory estrogen at the physiological level did not alter the depressor and bradycardic responses to the bst stimulation by glutamate.',\n",
       " \"The nutmeg plant is a member of the small primitive family called myristicaceae. nutmeg has long been known for its psychoactive properties ( producing anxiety / fear , hallucination ) nutmeg is widely accepted as a flavouring agent, and was used in higher doses ( 500mg / kg ) as aphrodisiac and psychoactive agent in male rat. The kidney also plays a major role in drug metabolism , but its major importance to drugs is still its excretory functions. It would be worthwhile to examine the effects of nutmeg on the kidneys of adult wistar rat thereby either corroborating previous work done by other researchers , or disproving the toxic effects ofNutmeg in this organ. This study was given approval for the methodology and other ethical issues concerning the work by the university of benin research ethics committee. Twenty - four adult wistar rats of both sexes with average weight of 220 g were randomly assigned into three groups : a, b and c of ( n=8 ) in each group. rats in the treatment groups ( a & b) were given 0.1 g ( 500mg / kg body weight) and 0.2 g ( 1000mg /kg body weight ) of nutmeg thoroughly mixed with the feeds respectively on a daily basis for forty - two days ( 6 weeks ) . the control group ( c) received equal amount of feeds without nutmeg added for the same period. blood samples were collected and analyzed for blood urea nitrogen ( bun ) and serum creatinine ( scr ) by using the commercial kits on the The rats in the treatment groups ( a & b) were given 0.1 g ( 500mg / kg body weight) and 0.2 g ( 1000mg /kg body weight ) of nutmeg thoroughly mixed with the feeds respectively on a daily basis for forty - two days ( 6 weeks ) The control group ( c) received equal amount of feeds without nutmeg added for the same period. blood samples were collected and analyzed for blood urea nitrogen ( bun ) and serum creatinine ( scr ) by using the commercial kits on the forty- third day of the experiment. The result of this experiment revealed that nutmeg consumption caused significant ( p<0.05 ) increase in functional nephrotoxicity indicators such as bun 0.1 g of nutmeg reveals some level of cyto - architectural distortion ( cad ) . the kidney sections of animals in group b treated with 0.2g / day of nut cloves revealed marked distortion of the renal cortical structures. The renal corpuscles were less identified and the bowman 's spaces were sparsely distributed as compared to the control group.  nutmeg resulted in increased toxic effect on the kidney. Our results are in agreement with previous studies that indicated nutmeg to be toxic to the kidneys when abused. It is recommended that caution should therefore be advocated in the intake of this product and further studies be carried out to examine these findings.\",\n",

       " 'mesoporous semiconductor oxide electrodes are used in different applications including electrochemical sensing, electrochromic devices and photoelectrochemical generation of fuels or electrical energy. The macroscopic rate of charge transfer between the mesoporous film and a conductive substrate is the result of a sequence of intermingled microscopic processes. electrochemical methods such as cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy have proven useful in characterizing electronic states.  electron accumulation is compensated by the adsorption of ions at the oxide surface. The reversibility of this charge accumulation opens up the possibility of driving fast reduction reactions at the semiconductor / electrolyte interface. Electrochemical doping was found to modify, at least temporarily, the electrode performance in different applications ranging from dye - sensitized solar cells to photocatalysis and supercapacitors. In this work, we combine first - principles theoretical calculations with the electrochemical characterization of nanostructured rutile tio2 films to demonstrate that particle / particle interfaces introduce deep traps. These interfaces represent favorable locations for proton segregation, which can be induced by electrochemical doping of the porous electrodes. The passivation of recombination by e / h doping leads to a transient photocurrent enhancement due to improved electron / hole separation. The nanoparticle films were annealed and sintered for 1 h at 450 c in air. After sintering a film thickness of 3.5  2.0 m was determined by scanning electron microscopy. The films are formed by a random network of elongated particles with a length of 50 nm and a width of 20 nm. The 3d and 4s electrons of ti and the 2s and 2p electrons of o are treated as valence electrons and expanded in a plane wave basis with energies up to 500 ev. Using the perdew  burke ernzerhof exchange correlation functional we obtain lattice parameters within 2% of experiment ( a = 4.67  and c = 3.03) Rutile tio2 nanoparticle electrodes and nanocolumn electrodes are used to model the effect of nanocrystal organization and interconnection on electrochemical and photoelectrochemical properties. We identify proton positions within 1.0  0.1 of each lattice oxygen ion that has the lowest electrostatic potential. We then use these positions to determine the initial coordinates for full geometry relaxations. The results can be applied to modeling protons in low symmetry structures. 2 films by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy have demonstrated the presence of a broad exponential distribution of states below the conduction band edge. currents in the accumulation region of rutile tio2 electrodes have been attributed to the population / depopulation of electronic states compensated by proton adsorption at the oxide surface. We will focus in detail on the intensity of these signals and on the energetics of the associated trap states. It is possible that not all of the deep traps in the mesoporous film are equilibrated with the fermi level of the conducting substrate. This is the reason why even large perturbation techniques such as  cyclic voltammetry may yield for deep trap states only apparent chemical capacitances. We performed charging and discharging measurements using extremely long lasting perturbations in the potential range featuring the capacitive peaks.  electrochemical doping has a beneficial effect on the photoelectrochemical performance of rutile tio2 np electrodes. The photocurrent generated by the electrode in a 0.1 m hclo4 aqueous solution containing 1 m methanol as a hole scavenger depends significantly on the electrochemical pretreatment of the film.  photocurrent enhancement by electrochemical doping is a very slow process. Only after 4 h of polarization at 0.6 v no further changes after such a long doping time the photocurrent has experienced  an increase by a factor of 7. The photocurrent increase is reversible with respect to prolonged polarization at positive potentials ( figure s8) Deep electron traps gives rise to a couple of capacitive peaks in the cv. This signal is virtually absent  in films consisting of oriented nanocolumn arrays ( nc electrodes ) ( ii) prolonged polarization of np electrodes at eag / agcl = 0.6 v ( electrochemical or charge transfer  reductive doping ) induces a displacement of these peaks by 0.08 v. These changes are reversible with respect to charge extraction ( dedoping ) upon prolonged electrode polarization. At finite temperature electrons may hop between ti sites at the interface. The presence of deep traps at this interface provides a semiquantitative model for the voltammetric feature of electron trapping states. The energy scale and the electrochemical potential scale have opposite signs. A trap state becoming more stable ( i.e. , deeper ) will be characterized by a more negative trapping energy. The most stable h incorporation site is found at the  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 grain boundary and is 0.6 ev more stable than in the bulk. The presence of h induces a transformation in structure near the grain boundary as compared to the pristine structure. One of the ti ions near thegrain boundary relaxes toward the oh ion. We next investigate the interaction of electrons with the h decorated grain boundary structure. Proton plus electron defects produced by h doping are referred to as ( h)(e ) centers. The defect can be considered as a h atom with the proton and electron dissociated onto  neighboring sites. We find a distribution of trapping energies for ti ions within 6 of the grain boundary plane. . traps  with et < 0 , hereafter referred to as interface traps ) . this corresponds to an interface trap concentration of 1.89  10 cm with an average  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 trapping energy of 0.14 ev. following ( h)(e)-doping the number of. interface traps are found to trap electrons corresponding to 0.95  10cm . analysis of atomic structures indicates that a number. of effects are responsible for the modification of interfacial traps. Electrochemical methods based on charge / discharge measurements provide information on the distribution of electrochemically active states. It must not be ignored that a persistent charge accumulation in the mesoporous film may modify both the fermi level and the density of states itself. Our observations from electrochemical measurements and results give a consistent picture of electron and proton trapping in nanocrystalline tio2 films. Charge accumulation takes place mainly at the particle surface and at those grain boundary states located near the oxide / electrolyte interface. Charge accumulation is not reversible on the time scale of a cv measurement. The partial removal of interface traps upon ( h)(e ) decoration of particle / particle interfaces may contribute to such a capacitance change. The increased intensity of the pair of capacitive peaks associated with traps at the particle / particle interface can be explained by the enhanced conductivity of the doped film. The persistence of electrochemical doping is associated with the slow kinetics of h diffusion from the gb core to the oxide / electrolyte interface. The increased photoelectrocatalytic activity of doped electrodes can be attributed to the deactivation of a major fraction of interface traps and recombination sites. We have tracked the long lasting accumulation of electron / proton pairs in rutile tio2 films. We believe that our findings will contribute to a better understanding of interfacial processes at play in different metal oxide - based materials. theoretical calculations indicate that interfaces between crystals in tio1 represent favorable locations for the segregation of proton defects. We have shown that doping of grain boundaries significantly alters the electronic properties of the particle / particle interface.',\n",
       " 'hainan island is separated from the mainland of southern china by the narrow strait of hainan , which 17 to 20 km wide. It is the second largest island in china , with a land area of 34,000 km , and the most southern province in ch China. The fauna of haanan island comprises about 112 species of mammal , including 27 species of bat belonging to seven families. The diploid number ( 2n) was determined by observing 30 metaphase cells in each specimen. The fundamental number ( fn) was defined as the total number of autosomal arms. The karyotype of r. lepidus from hainan island was 2n = 62 and fn = 60 ( fig . 1 ) , consisting of 30 medium - sized to small acrocentric autosomal pairs, a large subtelocentric x chromosome, and a small acrcentric y chromosome. The two subspecies from hainsan ( r. pusillus parcus and r. affinis hainanus) showed no karyological differences from previous reports. The karyotype 2n = 62 , fn = 60 is likely the conserved among the species and subspecies of the genus rhinolophus. It is shared by r. lepidus, r. pusillus , r. affinis and r. macrotis. Recent karyotypes study suggested that 2n=58 is more closely related to ancestral karyotypic of genus 17. The karyotype of myotis horsfieldi from hainan island does not differ from conspecific population in borneo 32. A diploid number 2n = 44 characterizes all 47 species for which karyotypes have been reported. chromosomal variation is essentially restricted to the presence of heterochromatic short arms on the smaller autosomes. Eight species of bats from hainan island examined in this study did not show any karyological differences from the conspecific populations or congeneric species from southern china and adjoining regions. morphological and genetic studies are also desired for more precise evaluation of the diversification and the taxonomic status of bats in the island.  rhinolophus pusillus and r. affinis are widely distributed in the indomalayan region and china and each contains nine subspecies 26. A secondary constriction was detected in one pair of medium - sized acrocentric chromosomes in both species. The karyotype 2n = 62 , fn = 60 is likely the conserved among the species and subspecies of the genus. The karyotype of myotis horsfieldi was 2n = 44 , fn = 50 , consisting of three large and one small metacentric or submetacentric pairs and 17 medium - sized to small acrocentric pairs in autosomes. This species had a prominent secondary constriction involving one pair of medium -sized acro centered chromosomes. The karyological differences between r. sinicus and r. rouxii support the view that these two taxonomically confused taxa both represent distinct species, as previously proposed. The karyotype of pipistrellus abramus from hainan island does not differ from conspecific populations from the chinese provinces of zhejiang, henan, and sichuan. Large negative g - band and positive c - band areas were found in the pericentromeric regions of chromosome 1 through 4, 10 , 11 and x. The hainan bats are considered conspecific with the populations in southern china and adjoining regions. morphological and genetic studies are also desired for more precise evaluation of the diversification and the taxonomic status of bats in hainans island. The karyological characteristics are very conservative in some genera as discussed above.',\n",
       " \"Chronic macrocheilia is swelling of one or both lips for more than 6 to 8 weeks. Leprosy is a specific granulomatous condition caused by mycobacterium leprae that has a high predilection for skin and peripheral nerves. occasionally, it may present with chronic macrocheili and can be misdiagnosed as miescher 's cheilitis. Cheilitis granulomatosa ( of miescher 's ) appears as nontender persistent swelling of one or both lips. melkersson - rosenthal syndrome was ruled out as bell 's palsy and scrotal tongue were absent. crohn 's disease shows lip swelling along with gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain or diarrhea.  dermatologist could observe the features such as scaling along with erythema in bilateral cheek region. dense , chronic inflammatory infiltrate composed predominantly of lymphocytes and plasma cells were seen around perivascular and periadnexal structures. diagnosis of borderline lepromatous ( bl ) leprosy with type 1 skin reaction was made. patient was started with multibacillary - multidrug therapy ( mb - mdt ) after 3 months follow up the lip swelling of the patient was reduced considerably. Oral lesions in leprosy are of great epidemiological significance as a source of infection and are late manifestations of the disease. in oral cavity , the most frequently affected site is hard palate and tongue , uvula , and lips are less frequently affected sites. Leprosy is the third most common cause of chronic macrocheilia after cheilitis granulomatosa and tuberculosis. Chronic lepromatous infections can cause pinkish discolorations of crowns due to the granulomatous invasion of pulpal tissues. mdt is the mainstay of leprosy treatment as it not only cures the patient , but also reduces the reservoir of infection thereby interrupting the spread of disease. The authors have obtained the necessary patient consent forms where the patients have given their approval for participation in the investigation. The patients do understand that the authors will ensure that their identities wo n't be revealed , however anonymity can not be guaranteed.  to conclude , chronic lip swelling may be an atypical and rare presentation of leprosy leproSy should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of chronic macrocheilia in an endemic country.\",\n",
       " \"Patients were selected consecutively at the outpatient clinic for dysphagia at the department of otorhinolaryngology. The status of the oral feeding restrictions was scored using the functional oral intake scale ( fois ) of crary et al. Two subjects were tube dependent while all other subjects were on a totally oral diet. According to chen et al .   the range of scores is 0 to 100 , while using a scale of 15. The dhi is a 30-item questionnaire on deglutition - related aspects of daily life. The questionnaire is subdivided into three domains of ten items : emotional ( psychosocial consequences ) , functional ( nutritional ) and physical. The mdadi consists of 20 items and includes a global assessment and three subscales. The global assessment refers to the individual s swallowing difficulty as it affects one's overall daily routine. The emotional, functional, and physical subscales refer to the affective response to the swallowing disorder and the impact of the disorder on daily activities. The dysphagia severity scale is a self-designed evaluation tool. cronbach s is an index of internal consistency of a psychological test ranging from 0 to 1. factor analysis is a set of statistical methods for analyzing the correlations among several variables. goodness of fitt is the degree of agreement between an empirically observed distribution and a mathematical or theoretical distribution.

       " 'migraine is a disabling neurological condition that is commonly observed to occur in an episodic manner. The pathophysiology of migraine is unclear, but several studies have demonstrated abnormalities in pain - processing mechanisms. Inflammation has long been suggested to play a role in migraine. Mutations in the mefv gene are responsible for innate immunity disorders. These disorders are associated with activation in the interleukin-1 pathway. This pathway leads to sustained activation of inflammatory cascade and severe inflammation. serum levels of tumor necrosis factor  ( tnf- ) , interleUKin-6, interleukairein-8 , and soluble interleukein-2r are significantly increased during fmf attacks. Migraine was diagnosed according to the international classification of headache disorders criteria. 30 patients with obesity ( body mass index > 30 ) , diabetes , or other neurologic or psychiatric disorders were excluded from this study. The control group consisted of 228 volunteers who applied to the other outpatient clinic at dicle university. To detect the mutation , we used an snp fmf real - time pcr kit ( snpfmf-8) This kit contains ready - to - use patented wild - type and mutant master mixes for each mutation. genotyping was performed using the 5 nuclease method. All migraine patients who registered at the department of neurology outpatient clinic at dicle university, turkey, between January 2014 and January 2015 were included in this study. Patients with obesity ( body mass index > 30 ) , diabetes , or other neurologic or psychiatric disorders were excluded from the study. The control group consisted of 228 volunteers who applied to the other outpatient clinic.  whole blood samples ( 2 ml) were taken into ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid - treated tubes and stored at 20c. genotyping was performed for the most frequent eight missense mutations : m694v, m680i, v726a, r761h, k695r, e148q and p369s. migraine patients were assigned to two subgroups : with mefv gene mutation and without mefV gene mutation. During pcr , the 5 nuclease activity cleaves the probe and releases the reporter dye. As the amount of the amplification product accumulates, the fluorescent signal increases linearly. The distributions of the genotype and polymorphism between migraine and control groups were compared by using  test or fisher s exact test. There was no significant difference in age or sex between the groups. The frequency and duration of attacks in the migraine group were 4.233.40 attacks per month and 23.9415.61 hours , respectively. The difference in total mefv mutation carriage rates and allele frequencies between the migraine and control groups was not statistically significant. This is the first study to investigate the effect of mutations in the mefv gene on the risk of developing migraine. migraine is a common neurological condition involving recurrent attacks of severe, pulsating, unilateral headaches. There was a statistically significant association between the homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in. the meFv gene and migraine. Pyrin protein is expressed in the inflammatory cells including dendritic cells, monocytes , and granulocytes. pyrin plays an important role in the regulation of innate immunity and inflammation. mefv mutations could be responsible for increased frequencies of migraine attacks.  e148q has little or no effect on the phenotype or on overall inflammatory disorders, such as fmf and other conditions. The exon 10 of the mefv gene includes mutations with high frequency , and it is located in the b30.2 domain of the pyrin. These mutations represent disease - causing mutations such as m694v. The results of the present study suggest that biallelic mutations in the meFv gene could be associated with a risk of migraine. kish population . moreover , mefv mutations could be related to increased attack frequencies and shorter durations of attacks in migraine disease. however , we did not observe any significant association between the allele frequencies of mefV mutations and migraine disease . future studies in larger groups and expression analysis of pyrin levels are required to clarify the role of the mef v gene in migraine susceptibility.',\n",
       " 'White button mushrooms ( agaricus bisporus ( lange ) imbach ) were grown at 18c day and night temperature and 88% relative humidity on horse manure / barley straw compost at the commercial production facility of egehj champignon a / s , veflinge , denmark in 2009. Two experiments were carried out with exposure of mushrooms to uv - b doses in the range of 0250mj cm over three days ( experiment a) and 2202,400 mj cm during one day ( experiment b) In experiment b, seven plots of 0.40.4 m were established on the shelves with growing mushrooms in a growth chamber. treatments at 220, 500, 1,000 and 2,400 mj m supplementary uv - b were given to the plots in a complete randomised statistical design. All plots were sampled immediately after exposure and also on the three consecutive days ( at 24 hour periods ) after the first day exposure to 0 or 200 mj cm. 1 g freeze - dried mushrooms were taken for analysis. Vitamin d3 was added as an internal standard according to en12821. The samples were extracted by alkaline saponification followed by clean - up by silica solid phase extraction. A c18 column combined with a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile : methanol ( 80:20 ) was used to separate vitamin d2 from ergosterol. White button mushrooms ( agaricus bisporus ( lange ) imbach ) were grown at 18c day and night temperature and 88% relative humidity on horse manure / barley straw compost. mushrooms were sampled for yield and vitamin d2 analyses at harvest according to the sampling practice for commercial harvest - ready mushrooms. multiple comparisons were based on values of the least significant difference derived from analysis of variance. Seven plots of 0.60.4 m were established on the shelves with growing mushrooms in a growth chamber. treatments at 220, 500, 1,000 and 2,400 mj m supplementary uv - b were given to the plots in a complete randomised statistical design. All plots were sampled immediately after exposure and also on the three consecutive days ( at 24 hour periods ) after the first day exposure. 1 g freeze - dried mushrooms were taken for analysis. Vitamin d3 was added as an internal standard according to en12821. The samples were extracted by alkaline saponification followed by clean - up by silica solid phase extraction. A c18 column combined with a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile : methanol ( 80:20 ) was used to separate vitamin d2 from ergosterol. The relationship between vitamin d2 concentration in mushrooms and exposure to uv - b dose up to 250 mj cm in experiment a and up to 2,400 mjcm in experiment b was very similar. mushrooms sampled after overnight cooling and post - harvest exposure were found to have a higher Vitamin d2 content. This difference was not caused by effects of overnight cooling on dry matter content. The formation of vitamin d2 levelled off at a content of 164 g 100 g at the high dose of 2,400 mj cm supplementary uv - b. A clear browning effect was observed on the surface of the exposed mushrooms indicating that at high doses of uv there was damage to the surface cells. The fast growth rate of the mushrooms diluted the vitamin d1 formed after exposure on day 1. Vitamin d2 concentration in mushrooms found during the three days of experiment a after exposure to supplementary uv - b of 200 mj cm. When the uv- b exposure was repeated at daily intervals ( day 13 ) , the vitamin d2 content increased to 33 g 100 g. These results suggest that repeated exposure to uV - b is needed just prior to harvest and during all days of a flush to ensure a high level of vitamin d 2 in the final product. Uv - b exposure is similar to the exposure of wild mushrooms that is not reported to cause toxic elements in mushrooms. The level of vitamin d2 content in wild and cultivated mushrooms with or without exposure to sunlight is comparable to that of 0.40.7 g in 100 g of pork and beef meat and 0.20.4 g in a variety of cheeses. The upper safe limit for daily intake of 50 g vitamin d 2 should be taken into consideration. Commercial growers may consider using uv- b during the growth phase for vitamin d1 formation in white button mushrooms. Uv - b - enhanced vitamin d2 levels in mushrooms provide a potentially important food source of vitamin d. mushrooms would contribute to 26% of the recommended daily intake of 7.5 g based on the average intake of mushrooms by adults of 3 kg yr in 2006 in denmark ( 12 )',\n",
       " 'Perissodus microlepis is a specialized scale - eater from lake tanganyika that nips scales off the posterior flanks of larger prey fish. Their mouths bend to one side of the head, which allows them to strike from a more posterior orientation that makes them less visible to intended victims. A single locus is thought to control the direction of mouth - bending , with right bending being dominant. frequencies of right- and left - bending individuals appear to vary cyclically around 50:50 over time. Among six species of scale - eating cichlids , including p. microlepis , geometric morphometric measures of overall head - shape asymmetry ( when viewed laterally ) were only significant in adults of one of the two most derived species. measurements of lower jaw mechanical advantage differed between right- and left - bending forms in the twomost derived scale - eaters. The distribution of jaw bending angles was clearly unimodal and centered on zero ( see figure 4c of ) If two alleles at a single locus induce discrete right- and left - bending morphs, then two questions arise. Why do so many juveniles ( close to one - third ) exhibit no significant mouth bending ? and why does asymmetry not materialize as a bimodal distribution of right - left differences ? Cichlid mouth asymmetry might be inherited like visceral asymmetry in mice. A dominant allele causes mouth bending towards one side but a recessive allele yields random phenotypes. Equal frequencies of right- and left - bending offspring are not consistent with either model i or ii. Recent studies suggest an exciting new dimension to the scale - eating cichlid story. The stronger the lateralized behavior of individual fish, the more pronounced the mouth asymmetry. Side of attack may therefore matter just as much as kind of prey eaten. Studies of right - left asymmetries offer valuable clues about how development evolves.',\n",
       " ' bone - anchored hearing aids ( baha) are the most widely used percutaneous type device. skin penetrating abutment of baha occasionally develops soft tissue problems and has poor aesthetic outcome. sophono alpha 2 system ( sophono inc . , boulder , co , usa ) has been commercially available in korea. We compared sophono with baha by the operation time, wound healing time, postoperative complications , postoperative hearing gain after switch on, and postoperative air - bone ( ab ) gap. single vertical incision without skin thinning technique was used for baha implantation as described previously. The mean time required for surgery was 60 minutes ( range , 40 to 105 minutes ) for sophono and 25 minutes forbaha. Unaided mean ac hearing of baha was 62.5 db ( standard deviation [ SD ] , 1.8 ) aided mean free - field ac hearing. of sophono was 29 db ( SD , 10.8) postoperative ab gap between the two groups was 16.6 db at 0.5 khz and 26.7 db at 4 khz. however , the difference was not statistically significant. The audiogram of patient who was implanted with sophono and baha was shown in fig. The mean time required for surgery was 60 minutes ( range , 40 to 105 minutes ) for sophono. skin infection , skin growth over the abutment , and fixture extrusion were not observed in any of these cases during follow-up period. The operation time of sophono took 35 minutes longer than baha. During baha surgery with the single vertical incision without skin thinning technique , there was no need to reduce soft tissue or to elevate the flap. in the sophono surgery in addition , sophono needed flap elevation and more drilling the skull for the internal device. Baha was better than sophono in bilateral aural atresia cases. Direct bone oscillation of baha could be thought to improve signal transmission. A 5 to 20 db increase in gain with baha implant compared to baha headband at 1 to 4 khz levels was reported.',\n",

Since only 10 english papers about mfpp have been previously published , little is known about its pathogenesis. In this report , we describe a case of mFpp showing a dense deposition of periostin ( postn ) in the cancer stroma. This deposition might modulate the tumor microenvi ronment through tumor - associated macrophages. The pathogenesis and biological behaviors of mfpp are still incompletely understood. radiotherapy is one of the best therapies for mpff. excimer laser therapy ( 308 nm ) and bexarotene are also effective. No patients have died from disease progression. ams were not polarized to the m2 phenotype, which might be responsible for the good prognosis in mfpp. Since we did not directly prove the relationships between immunomodulatory effects of postn and prognosis of mFpp , further analysis of the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon may provide fundamental insights into the mechanisms of post n with mfPP.',\n",

       " \"Transesterification process for production of biodiesel is an important issue due to diminishing fossil fuel reserves and rising crude oil price. Homogenous chemical catalyst processes, including alkali or acid, are more practical compared with the enzymatic method. calcium oxide cao has attracted attention due to the elimination of neutralization step and high activity. usks and crabs shells collected from seafood restaurants in an attempt to reach an effective process for practical , low cost industrial biodiesel production. pure calcium oxide as heterogeneous catalyst and methanol ( ar grade ) were purchased from fluka chemical corp . , gillingham , uk. novozym 435 ( candida antarctica lipase b ) was a gift from novozyme a / s , bagsvaerd , denmark. Twenty runs of experiments have been conducted for three levels of four independent variables : methanol, oil m, catalyst and reaction time. The activity of the prepared biocatalysts was compared with that of commercially available catalysts and enzymes. The produced biodiesel was tested for estimating and evaluating its yield. A prediction model was used to determine curvature and detect interactions among the design factors. The thermal transition during the calcination process of each collected waste shells was investigated with tga / dsc. The results were compared with the egyptian standards for petro - diesel and european and american standards of biodiesel ( en14214 and d-6751 , resp . ) all the properties were analyzed in two replicates and the final results were obtained as the average values.  ms and cs turned completely pale grey and white during calcination. This indicates that calcium carbonate caco3 is converted to cao with elevating calcination temperatures. The xrd patterns of natural ms are mainly aragonite caco 3 ( jcpds card number : 024 - 0025 ) and upon calcination at 400c , it was changed to calcite Caco3. The natural cs is composed mainly of crystalline calciteCaco3 and monohydrocalcite c Taco3h2o. The obtained xrd pattern could explain the tga / dsc flowcharts of cs. The crystal size was calculated from the xrd data ( table 1 ) , recording 42.15  nm for natural ms , which decreased upon calcination at 800c , recording 38.77  nm . similar observation was reported by yoosuk et al .   who attributed this to the presence of water molecules during calcination of caco3 to cao. The crystalline size of the uncalcinated cs was found to be 32. 15  nm and it was slightly increased by calcination  at 700c, recording 32.82  nm. The ftir patterns of ms and cs with respect to calcination process were nearly the same. The observed changes in ir patterns might indicate the complete transformation of caco3 to cao. The temperatures of 800c and 700c were selected as perfect calcination temperature to prepare biocatalysts from natural mollusks and crabs shells. Porosity is probably due to the fact that a large number of gaseous water molecules are released upon the decomposition of caco3h2o. smaller particles with higher specific surface area upon calcination at 700c. because the prepared biocatalyst has relatively large particle sizes , it is easy to separate the catalyst from the products after the reaction. The n2 adsorption - desorption isotherms of the prepared cao from ms and cs are shown in figures 6(a) and 6(b) and they are of type ii isotherm ( based on iupac 's classification ) with a low slope in the middle region of the is otherm. applying bet equation , p / po = 0.9590 and 0. 9482 ( < 1 ) and c = 7.152 and 17.012 ( > 1 ) , respectively , indicating monolayer formation. The complete design matrix with experimental and predicted values of % yield of biodiesel using different cao catalyst prepared from mollusks and crabs shells is presented in table 3. In case of using biocatalyst prepared from ms in the transesterification process, only the m :  o molar ratio has positive impact. Reaction time has a high negative impact followed by catalyst concentration and mixing rate, in a decreasing order. The positive interactive impact on the biodiesel yield was expressed by m:  o and catalyst loading. The relationship between predicted and experimental values of biodiesel yield for cao prepared from ms and cs is shown in figures 8(a ) and 8(b ) . it can be seen that there is a high correlation ( r  1 ) between the predicted and Experimental values. this suggests that approximately 99.96% and 99.64% of the variance is attributed to the variables. All the parameters, within the studied range , have highly significant effect on the biodiesel yield except the mixing rate ( d ) which has relatively nonsignificant effect. The maximum yield 92% occurred within the range 6  :  16.5  wt% catalyst concentration. Further increase in m :  o and catalyst slightly decreased the biod diesel yield to 84%. Figure 10(c) represents the effect of m  :  o and mixing rate on biodiesel production at a constant reaction time 30  min and ms - cao concentration 3  wt% . biod diesel production recorded its maximum yield 92% at 6  :\\xa0 16.5 m: o molar ratio and 200250  rpm. But the biodiesel yield slightly decreased with further increment of m:  o molars ratio and time reaching 86% at 12 :  1 m:\\xa0 o and 120  min. Molar ratio of methanol to oil m  :  o higher than the stoichiometric ratio has generally been adopted for biodiesel production. At low m : o ratio the increase of catalyst concentration decreased the biodiesel yield. But at high m: o ratio, the yield increased with increase of the catalyst loading. The maximum biodiesel production using cao prepared from crabs shells cs - cao can be achieved at 10.5  :  112 :  1 m :  o , 7.59% catalyst concentration , 3050  min reaction time , and mixing rate of 200300  rpm , at 60c. However, at high mixing rate 400  rpm the opposite occurred ; increasing the catalyst loading decreased the yield. The program combines the individual desirability into a single number and then searches to optimize this function based on the response goal. The maximum predicted biodiesel yields 94 and 100% were found to be achieved at 6  :  1 and 12   1 m :  o , 4.5 and 7.3 catalyst wt% , 82 and 30  min reaction time , and 220 and 214  rpm mixing rate , in case of using biocatalyst prepared from mollusks and crabs shells. The produced biodiesel using the obtained optimum transesterification conditions of each of the prepared biocatalysts was evaluated on the basis of its fuel properties compared to egyptian petro - diesel and international biodiesel standards as shown in table 6. All the properties of the produced biod diesel are completely acceptable and meet most of the specifications . so it can be ranked as a realistic fuel and as an alternative to petro- diesel. The produced biodiesel was characterized by higher specific gravity ( 0.8924 and 0.9011 , resp . ) and lower api value ( 27.06 and 25.53 , resp ). It is ultralow sulfur biofuel with sulfur content of 0.0030. It is much less flammable fuel than petro - diesel and hence it is much safer. Cao catalyst prepared from waste mollusks and crabs shells can be recommended for biodiesel production from waste cooking oil collected from seafood restaurants. This would have a triple positive impact on environment, economic , and energy sectors. Further work is undertaken now in epr - biotechnology laboratory concerning the kinetics and mechanism of the transesterification process.\",\n",

An unusual metabolic change occur leading to loss of various dhatus ( tissue ) such as ojokshaya , sukra and meda. This is known as pratilomakshaya. In the first phase studies related to the ayurvedic management of tb as an adjunct therapy are delineated and in the next part the studies  related to ayur Vedic drugs showing in - vitro anti - tb properties are described. The rasayana used in this study is composed of amalaki ( emblica officinalis gaertn.) and guduchi ( tinospora cordifolia willd.)

A couple of single drugs and compound drugs are useful for the management of tb. However, none of the studies could reflect the true anti - tb activities of any drug , both single and compound. Two studies revealed in vitro anti-tb properties of some herbs which can potentially be brought into the realm of a clinical trial to test their efficacy. The commonest improvement as a result of ayurvedic intervention is gain in body weight , which is undoubtedly a cardinal improvement in the part of a ptb patient. The adjunct intake of liv-600 capsule and decoction of bhumyamalaki could be extremely beneficial in combating hepatotoxicity as a consequence of administration of atds. A study conducted by kumar et al . showed anti - tb properties of five different legumes. Leaf extracts of the legumes completely inhibited the growth of m. tb at mic level of 50 g / ml. Since extracts are crude preparations they may be considered active at higher concentrations also. Research on the role of ayurveda in the management of tb is very scanty and mostly limited to adjunct or supportive therapy. The adjunct role ofAyurvedic drugs can not be simply neglected for not qualifying as agents to combat the m. tb. Their role as agents of increasing bioavailability of atds and counteracting the adverse drug interactions should be properly utilized.',\n",

Results from the two instruments were in good agreement ( not real or small bias , narrow 95% ci for the bias , no outliers ) for 8 analytes ( albumin , ast , ck , phosphate , k , tb , creatinine , and tp ; table 3 ) for alp the agreement was poor as the falcor generated higher alp results than the konelab ( table 3) regression plots for results with acceptable correlation ( rs > 0.80 ) and good agreement with unremarkable bland - altman plots are not shown. for na examination of the data revealed that in 29 of the 60 ( 48% ) cases , the falCor generated na values lower than those of the k Colonelab For urea the regression plot revealed 3 data points which deviated markedly from the calculated line of best fit as the falcor values were unexpectedly higher than those obtained from the konelab ( 41.5 versus 3.1 , 14.6 versus 5.2 , and 13.3 versus 4  mmol / l ) This inconsistency merits further investigation as similar findings have been reported in a very low number of samples from canine and feline clinical cases.  falcor is easy to handle and that a familiarisation period of one week is sufficient for routine use in general practice. for 8 of the 12 analytes the two instruments produce values that are closely related to each other ( good correlation ) and are sufficiently similar to allow them to be used interchangeably. good correlation and agreement are also demonstrated for urea values although the falcor in 3 samples generated inconsistent results. because of differences in the methodologies , the results for alp , tca , and na can not be used. interchangeably with those generated by the konelab.\",\n",
       " 'permanent prostate brachytherapy represents a highly efficacious treatment for clinically localized prostate cancer. as many as 50% of patients with a pre - treatment prostate specific antigen ( psa) < 10 ng / ml manifest extracapsular extension ( epe) Treatment margins can vary markedly between patients with comparable intra - prostatic dose distributions. There was no significant difference between monotherapy or boost treatments for the percentage dosimetric parameters v100 and d90 for i and pd. There was no statistically significant difference in prostate v100 or d90 when stratified by isotope or monotherapy vs. boost. The prostate was auto - margined by 5 mm in all directions except posterior , where the margin was 2 mm. Table 2 summarizes the mean margin sector analysis for v100 for the 4547 evaluated patients. The v100 at the base ( 51.6% ) was less than the apex ( 73.5% ) and the midgland ( 65.9% ) for the group as a whole. There was no significant difference between monotherapy or boost treatments for the percentage dosimetric parameters v100 and d90. The mean d90 and v100 were statistically lower in the 2- , 3- , and 5-mm expansions in patients with biopsy proven local failure. among patients without and with local recurrence , the mean v100 in the 5 mm - group were 77.4% and 72.4%. The current study is probably inadequate for monotherapeutic approaches. The optimal extracapsular brachytherapy dose and radial extent remains unknown. This will prove increasingly important with reductions and/or elimination of supplemental external beam radiation therapy. This eliminates our ability to establish a dose response curve for the annular dose necessary to secure long - term biochemical control.',\n",
       " 'intravascular catheters are indispensable in modern - day medical practice. Their use puts patients at risk for local and systemic infectious complications. The incidence of crbsi varies considerably by type of catheter and patient - related factors. More than 250,000 vascular catheter - related bacteremia and fungemia occur annually in the usa.  bacteremia / fungemia in a patient with an intravascular catheter with at least one positive blood culture obtained from a peripheral vein. Patients with fever prior to catheter placement and proven source for sepsis were excluded from this study. Blood was collected within 48 hours of catheter collection under all aseptic precautions. The commonest premorbidity among the controls and patients with crbsi was renal failure ( 36% versus 36.4% ) while that among the patients with local catheter infections was diabetes ( 28.2% ) The commonest purpose of cannulation was for administration of iv fluids and parenteral antibiotics as shown in table 1. Local signs of inflammation like erythema, warmth, induration , tenderness , and purulence at exit site were seen among all patients withcrbsi and among majority of patients withLocal catheter infection ( 97.4%) The most sensitive routine antibiotic for pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated in crli was piperacillin ( 85.7% sensitive ) and the most sensitive reserved antibiotics were cefoperazone - salbactum , piperAcillin - tazobactum and ticarcillin - clavulanic acid. The most sensitive reserve antibiotic was meropenem ( 50% sensitive) for k. pneumoniae isolated from crbsi. There were no routine antibiotics sensitive for e. coli isolated fromcrbsi and both were esbl producers. The incidence of catheter - related infections was the highest among patients with a femoral venous line ( 36%) and patients with subclavian, basilic and jugular venous accesses ( 20% versus 22%) as compared to controls. In subjects with triple lumen catheters, 40% cases had catheter related infections as compared with 26% of controls. All resistant staphylococcus ( mrsa and mrcons ) isolated from crli were 100% sensitive to vancomycin , teicoplanin , and linezolid. The most sensitive routine antibiotic for p. aeruginosa strains isolated in crli was piperacillin ( 85.7% sensitive ) and the most sensitive reserved antibiotics were cefoperazone - salbactum and meropenem. There was no routine antibiotic sensitive for e. coli or k. pneumoniae. The crbsi incidence density at our hospital is 8.75 per 1000 catheter days. femoral venous access was associated with a significantly higher incidence of local catheter infections ( 30.1% versus 26.5% versus 16.9% , resp . ) than jugular and subclavian access. The incidence of catheter - related infection was highest with triple lumen catheters. The number of mrsa isolated in our study is higher than that observed by pawar et al . false positive culture may result if skin contacts with catheter. if portion of the catheters not inside the patient is submitted , both false positive and false negative cultures are possible. potential pathogens may die if the removed catheter is not transported to the laboratory promptly.',\n",
       " 'propofol is a commonly used drug for induction of anesthesia because of its rapid onset and short duration of action. About 28 - 92% patients experience pain on injection of propofol , with one of three patients reporting severe or excruciating pain. We conducted a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled study to compare the efficacy of pretreatment with butorphanol and tramadol for alleviation of pain. All patients were advised to be kept nil per oral for 8 h prior to surgery and received uniform premedication in the form of tablet ranitidine 150 mg and tablet alprazolam 0.25 mg night before surgery. in the operating room, an iv line was secured in a peripheral vein on the dorsum of the hand with an 18-gauge iv cannula. electrocardiogram for heart rate and rhythm, systolic blood pressure, diastolic bloodpressure and mean arterial pressure were recorded. Based on the results of the previous study and assuming type - i error (  ) at 0.05 , type ii error ( ) at0.1 , and power of the study at 80% so as to detect a difference of 20% in the incidence of pain between the study and control groups the sample size was calculated as 26 patients in each group. The entire data were compiled and analyzed by using analysis of variance and chi - square test. In group i, the mean score of pain was ( vas  sd ) 2.27  1.51 while it was 1.14 and 1.72 in group ii and group iii patients, respectively. On statistical analysis, vas in group i was statistically significant as compared to group The other side effects observed besides pain included pruritus and erythema. The results of our study imply a significant reduction in pain on propofol administration after pretreatment with tramadol or butorphanol in comparison to the control placebo group. The higher incidence of patients experiencing higher mean vas scores ( 2.27  1.48 ) in group i ( placebo ) are comparable with the 74 - 83% incidence reported by various other studies. Tramadol inhibits noradrenaline re - uptake as well as promotes serotonin release. It potentiates the monoaminergic system and can be used to treat moderate and severe pain. The incidence of pain on propofol injection in this study after pretreatment with butorphanol was observed to be approximately 20%. uritus and erythema . though statistical significance could not be achieved among both study drugs. We propose future studies exploring use of both tramadol and butorphanol as a pretreatment in relieving pain on propofol injection in large samples of surgical population.',\n",
       " 'There is a relative paucity of articles reporting on outcome of treatment of glenoid fossa fractures. We present our experience of treating these injuries over past decade with operative and nonoperative methods. The mean age and followup period in this series was 29 years and 7.3 years respectively. The least constant score was observed for group b ( 58.55 ) while group c ( 86.8) We identified 21 cases with glenoid fossa fracture who were available for assessment after followup periods ranging from 2 to 14 years. road traffic accident was the most common mode of injury accounting for 15 cases. 12 patients had significant associated injury ( excluding ipsilateral shoulder girdle fractures) We tried to access only the lateral border of scapula through the intermuscular interval between infraspinatus and teres minor. We did not attempt to directly reduce or fix fractures extending to scapular body or vertebral border. At the final followup, patients were assessed for pain, function, range of movements, and strength using the constant score. The final result was reported as excellent, good, fair , or poor, depending on the difference in scores of abnormal and normal shoulders. The mean length of hospital stay was 15.2 , 32.3 , and 3.8 days in groups a, b, and c. Time for fracture union was the least in group c ( 5.5 weeks ) followed by group a ( 6.7 weeks ) and was the longest in group b ( 9.4 weeks ) But union was achieved in all cases without further intervention. Pain and function were the least affected at the final followup. Range of movements followed by strength were the most severely affected. Glenoid fossa fractures represent 10% of scapular fractures with overall prevalence of 0.1%. Majority of glenoid fractures are undisplaced and can be managed nonoperatively. The glenohumoral joint affords more degree of freedom of movement than any other joint. Postoperative infection remains a major cause of poor result. The most common mechanism of these injuries is a violent force applied laterally to the proximal part of the humerus which is then driven into the glenoid cavity. Time taken to achieve maximal improvement in shoulder constant score was the least in group a followed by groups c and b.  operative treatment for displaced glenoid fractures is a viable option at centers equipped to handle critically ill patients. lack of such treatment does not preclude a satisfactory outcome in all displaced fractures. A subset of patients with fracture dislocation as opposed to fracture alone should perhaps always be treated operatively due to persistent loss of function.',\n",
       " 'In the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe, 371 species of noncoding rna are predicted to be transcribed in vegetatively growing cells. rna transcripts often form bodies inside the nucleus. The best characterized long nonc coding rna is meirna, which forms a nuclear body in meiotic cells. Meirna is essential for premeiotic dna synthesis and entry into meiosis. It is also necessary for homologous chromosome pairing. The 0.5-kb meirna - s was the transcript originally annotated ( watanabe and yamamoto 1994 ) . A longer transcript of 1.5  kb was later characterized and named as meirne - l. mmi1 is a rna - binding protein which recognizes hexanucleotide the determinant of selective removal ( dsr ) motifs on meiosis - specific rnas. Red1 is present only in mitotic cells and plays a critical role in the degradation of dsr - containing rnas in vegetatively growing cells. mmi1 is sequestered from the rna degradation pathway by its binding to meirna. Meirna acts as a decoy for mmi 1 with the meirNA dsr motifs acting to bind and sequester mmione. Meirna was first annotated as a 508-nucleotide rna ( meirna - s ) essential for the progression of meiosis. We reexamined transcripts of the sme2 gene and found a 1.5-kb rna as the major transcript of the Sme2 genes. This 1 - 574 rna - l was required for robust pairing at the smE2 locus. Meirna transcripts bind and sequester mmi1 and also colocalize with mei2 at the sme2 gene locus. deletion of the polyadenylation sites of the smE2 gene eliminated the meirna body. A shorter adh1 terminator fragment ( 1058 - 1586 in fig. in fig . this suggests that properly terminated meirNA transcripts are necessary for their chromosomal retention. Although mechanisms for retention of rna transcripts at their respective genes are still largely unknown , these results suggest that chromosomal. retention may be coupled with polyadenyllation. The meirna transcript was visualized using a 4xu1a tag inserted at the 5 end of the sme2 gene and a u1a  gFP fusion construct. The 3-end 1058 - 1586 dna fragment was replaced with an adh1 terminator and a marker gene. pairing frequencies of theSme2 locus in the wild - type and 3 deletion mutants are indicated. We speculate that as yet unknown proteins may bind to the 3 end ofmeirna - l and play a role in chromosome recognition.  b complexes containing rna transcripts act as chromosome recognition sites along each of the chromosomes aligned by telomeres. c to find a homologous chromosome partner, recognition complexes ( yellow, green, and orange bulbs ) are placed on the chromosomes. as yet unknown proteins may bind to the 3 end of meirna - l and play a role in retention of rna on the chromosome. Meirna - l directly or indirectly mediates robust pairing at the sme2 locus. This pairing is independent of dsb formation and , hence, independent of recombination. This strongly suggests that chromosomes can recognize their homologous partners without direct interaction between dna sequences. oding ( or protein - coding ) rna is transcribed in the early stages of meiosis. arrays of rna bodies along chromosomes likely act as chromosome identifiers for the recognition of homologous chromosomes. further studies will provide more insight into the role of rNA nuclear bodies in the recognition. of homologueous loci during meiosis .',\n",

       " 'The electrical conduction across the grain - boundaries in 1  mol% sr - doped lagao3 is governed by the space charge. The physical behavior of grain boundaries differs from that of the bulk due to their structural deviation from the crystal interior. The size effects on the conductivity have become one of the main foci of research interest, particularly in the field of solid state ionics. Doped lagao3 is a perovskite - structured oxygen - ionic conductor. It presents a conductivity higher than the conductivities of fluorite- structured ses at lower temperatures. However, the electrical nature of the grain boundaries in this se resembles that in fluorite ses. The grain boundaries block the oxygen- ionic transport in the materials. Grain - boundary resistance is the space charge , as seen in the fluorite - structured ses. Figure 1 shows a high - resolution transmission electron microscope image of dense ( > 95% ) lsgo used for electrical measurements. The grain boundaries appear to be free of pores as well as insulating amorphous phases.  resistances in lsgo were measured using both ac - impedance spectroscopy and a dc - measurement technique. The advantage of the ac technique is that it allows one to measure the local resistance ( e.g. , in the bulk and the grain boundary ) separately. The dielectric constant of ~30 at 400  c estimated from c1 ( = ( r11nq1 ) ) agrees well with that of pure lagao3 ( ~25 ) 2nyquist plots measured from lsco under o2 ( red symbols ) and n2 ( blue symbols ) at 400  c . the solid lines indicate the best fits obtained using an equivalent circuit consisting of two parallel rq elements. It is interesting to note that arc 2 varies with varying ambient. The electronic transference number ( tj  =  j/kk ) at the grain boundaries ( tel , gb ) is greater than that in the bulk ( tel, ) . According to eq .  1 , at equilibrium , the local concentration of defect j in the vicinity of the grain - boundary core is determined by the electrical potential of the core. Fig. 2 strongly suggests that the grain - boundary conduction in lsgo is controlled by the space charge. One should measure the partial ionic and electronic conductivities at the grain boundaries and in the bulk separately to check whether tel , gb is in fact greater than tel. Figure 4 presents the current ( i)voltage ( u ) characteristics measured from an ion - blocking dc - polarization cell. Current ( i)voltage ( u ) characteristics measured from an ion - blocking dc - polarization cell. behavior to show the characteristic nonlinear i  u relation for a blocking cell as the voltage further increases. At relatively high temperatures ( > 750  c ) , the resistance in lsgo is predominantly determined by r ( i.e. rdc = rdc) Fig. 5 shows tel , gb and tel, estimated at different temperatures. The resistance at the electrodes is negligibly small at all temperatures of concern. Figure 5 verifies that the high grain - boundary resistance to oxygen - ionic transport observed in lsgo is due to the depletion of vo to form space charge zones at the grain boundaries.  lsgo was synthesized employing a pechini - type method using la(no3)3. The chemical composition as well as the concentrations of background impurities ( including ca and si ) in the pellets were determined using inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy ( icp) The electrical resistance of the pellet was measured as a function of temperature ( t  =  250~600  c ) under different oxygen partial pressures.  of the pellets were coated with a porous composite layer . the composite material was prepared by mechanically mixing lsg and lsm ( la0.8sr0.2mno3- , fcm , usa ) powders ( 1:1  wt% ) with the organic solvent.

The sniffin sticks test was initially developed and validated on large numbers of patients in germany. The kit is used by many clinicians around the world and has been validated in various countries and populations. The subjects were blindfolded to prevent visual identification of the odor - containing pens. 16 triplets of pens were presented with 2 containing the same odorant and 1 containing the target odorant. The subjects task was to identify the sample that had a different smell. The final step a test of odor identification was performed to completely assess the subjects objective function. Overall olfactory function is expressed as the sum of the scores from the 3 individual tests ( tdi score ) The participants were divided into 2 groups according to subjective olfactory function , either healthy or abnormal. Most participants ( 68% ) had a high educational level ( high school or university ) and there was no difference between the groups in terms of education and age. In the healthy group, peppermint , rose, fish, banana , cloves , garlic , and coffee were the odorants most reliably identified correctly. turpentine , apple, leather , lemon , and liquorice were most commonly mistaken. Cultural differences make the application of the odor identification tests in different countries difficult. In a validating study conducted in taiwan some descriptors were changed from the original version. The modifications in the list of descriptors after linguistic changes significantly increased the identification of problematic items. translation and cultural adaptation of the descriptor list in the identification subtest was used in studies conducted in brazil, sri - lanka and the netherlands. ine , liquorice , and pineapple . another possible reason for the difficulties in identification could lie in the odor itself. The currently used apple odor smells like granny smith apple and the participants confused this odor with air freshener. Some of the odors presented as distracters may not be very familiar to turkish populations.',\n",
       " 'during the past 50 years, apheresis therapy has been applied successfully in patients with different disturbances of lipid metabolism. In some diseases , e.g. , the chylomicronemia syndrome, aheresis is performed as an emergency treatment in hospitalized patients. In other diseases, such as refractory hypercholesterolemia and hyperlipoproteinemia, maintenance apheresi is required, usually on an ambulatory basis.  statins have the most important role in the medical treatment of elevated low - density lipoprotein ( ldl ) cholesterol. before considering apheresis, a combination drug therapy has to be performed to reach a therapeutic goal of ldl cholesterol <  70 mg / dl. nicotinic acid, which significantly reduces lipoproteinemia ( a ) levels by approximately 20  %, may be tried in hyperlipoprote cinemia. Several highly potent new drugs have been currently developed. Some pcsk9 antibodies may get the european medical agency ( ema ) and food and drug administration ( fda ) approval by the end of 2015. The impact on clinical outcome is a subject of current studies. There is still limited experience with the use of these drugs in patients on long - term apheresis. A target serum ldl cholesterol of <  70  mg / dl is recommended for patients with coronary heart disease ( chd ) equivalent. The same therapeutic goal should be achieved for both heterozygous and homozygous fh patients regardless of age, according to a recent consensus panel on fh. In germany, all homozygous fh patients will have long - term apheresis therapy starting at the age of 67 years at the latest. In patients with compound heterozygous diseases, it may be controversial to start apheresi early if native ldl cholesterol levels are markedly less than 500  mg / dl. A protective effect of the treatment with these news drugs with respect to atherosclerotic events still needs to be demonstrated. heresis . in germany , the indication for apheresis in hyperlipoproteinemia ( a ) is accepted only in the presence of progressive chd or chd equivalent. The decision as to at which point progression becomes significant and clinically relevant is often controversial. Hard end points frequently used in outcome studies are shown in table  2. There is profound ethical concern in patients with late - stage atherosclerotic disease to concede apheresis only after a progression has been documented. The ultimate therapy should start before progression to an ultimate cardiac or vascular event occurs. The strict pursual of such a protocol will possibly be lethal for many cardiac patients with severely reduced left ventricular function. Phytanic acid is central in the metabolism of this branched - chain fatty acid. Typical clinical signs are retinitis pigmentosa, peripheral polyneuropathy, cerebellar ataxia and progressive hearing loss. Long - term apheresis treatment may be indicated in patients with progressive clinical symptoms to prevent life - threatening complications.',\n",

       " \"we studied 3,811 pregnant women of european ancestry ( manchester and belfast , u.k . , and newcastle and brisbane , australia ) and 1,706 pregnantWomen of south east asian ancestry ( bangkok , thailand ) The protocol was approved by the institutional review board at each field center. All participants gave written , informed consent. We analyzed the association between each of the three primary outcome measures ( fasting plasma glucose , 1-h ogtt glucose , and 2-h Ogtt. fat mass / birth weight) We selected the gck and tcf7l2 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps) for association analysis. The frequency of the t - allele of gck rs1799884 ( associated with higher glucose levels ) ranged from 17.1 to 18.7% in the european samples. The type 2 diabetes risk allele frequency of tcf 7l2 rs7903146 ranged from 29.2 to 30.6% inThe europeans and was 4.7%. We created a high glucose variable with a value of 1 if the participant had one or more high values in the ogtt. The high glucose threshold corresponds to an odds ratio ( or ) of 1.75 , relative to the mean glucose level. We then analyzed the association between the odds of high glucose and the combined number of t - alleles at both loci. We compared the results with a full model ( including the allele score as indicator variables ) using a likelihood ratio test. We analyzed the association between each neonatal outcome and maternal genotype. All analyses of neonatal outcomes excluded babies born preterm ( before 37 full weeks of gestation ) and pregnancies in which caregivers were unblinded to maternal glucose levels. The association between genotype and birth weight was analyzed using linear regression under an additive genetic model. Since maternal and fetal genotypes are correlated , we then tested for evidence of a fetal genotype  birth weight association within each stratum. To address whether maternal gck and tcf7l2 genotypes improve prediction of birth weight or neonatal adiposity in the presence of different combinations of other known variables, we used logistic regression to model the odds. We used the medical record birth weight because it was more widely available and highly correlated with the hapo - hapo study outcome. We used the hapo study measures for length and head circumference and added medical record values when these were unavailable. fat mass at birth ( grams ) was derived using the following formula ( 32 ) :  bw is birth weight in grams, fls is flank skinfold thickness in millimeters , and bl is birth length in centimeters. from this , percent body fat was derived as follows : 100 fat mass / birth weight. All analyses were carried out using stata ( version 10 ; stata , college station , tx ) We analyzed the association between each of the three primary outcome measures ( fasting plasma glucose , 1-h ogtt glucose , and 2-hOgTT glucose ) and genotype using linear regression under an additive genetic model. We also sought to investigate the association of each snp with maternal glucose levels that carry a substantially higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcome. We generated principal components of ancestry using smartpca from the eigensoft software package ( 41 ) based on 141 ancestry informative markers that were genotyped in the same panel of 1,536 snps as the gck and tcf7l2 snps. We analyzed the association between each neonatal outcome and maternal genotype using linear regression ( additive genetic model ) . we performed the analysis twice : 1) a minimally adjusted model with field center ( european ancestry only ) , sex of the baby , and gestational age at delivery as covariates and 2) a fully adjusted model including maternal age at ogtt, maternal bmi at o gtt, parity, maternal smoking ( yes / no ) , To address whether fetal genotype alters the impact of maternal glucose levels on offspring birth weight, fat mass , or skinfold thickness, we used a likelihood ratio test. To address whether maternal gck and tcf7l2 genotypes improve prediction of birth weight or neonatal adiposity in the presence of different combinations of other known variables , we used logistic regression. The t - allele of tcf7l2 rs7903146 is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Age, bmi , and mean arterial pressure were measured at a median of 2829 weeks ' gestation depending on the field center. We observed associations between the gck rs1799884 variant and fasting glucose in both the european. and thai samples. There was evidence of heterogeneity between the european and thai samples for the fasting ( p = 0.03 ) and 2-h glucose measures but not the 1-h measure. There was also some evidence for association with fasting glucose ( 0.02 mmol / l higher per t - allele [ 0.0020.03 ] ; p =0.03) There was no association between the tcf7l2 variant and the maternal glucose measures in the thai sample. Analysis of the complete dataset showed strong evidence for a trend to increased odds of high glucose with an increasing number of t - alleles ( or 1.25 [ 95% ci 1.141.37 ] ; p < 0.00001 ) There was no evidence of deviation from a multiplicative model ( p = 0.28 ) association between gck or tcf7l2 genotype and high * maternal glucose levels. We analyzed the associations between the maternal gck and tcf7l2 variants and various neonatal traits. After bonferroni adjustment for 10 tests, there was no association at p < 0.05 with neonatal anthropometric traits at either locus. In the europeans, the gck rs1799884 effect size estimates for all traits were in the direction expected given the association with maternal glucose. The t - allele of gck rs1799884 is associated with raised fasting glucose in nondiabetic , nonpregnant populations. The effect sizes and p values are from linear regression of maternal glucose level against genotype. Age , bmi , and mean arterial pressure were measured at a median of 2829 weeks ' gestation. We observed associations between the gck rs1799884 variant and fasting glucose in both the european ( 0.03 mmol / l higher per t - allele [ 95% ci 0.010.05 ] ; p = 0.001 ) and thai samples. There was evidence of association with 2-h glucose in the thai sample. We observed no evidence for association at p < 0.05 between the tcf7l2 variant and the maternal glucose measures in the Thais. There were no associations between any of the maternal glucose outcomes and the tcf7l2 rs290487 or rs11196218 snps in the thai sample ( p > 0.05 ; data not shown ) . consistent with the results for continuous glucose measures , we observed associations between both the gck and tcf 7l2 variant and the odds of high glucose. We analyzed the associations between the maternal gck and tcf7l2 variants and various neonatal traits. We did not observe an association with cord c - peptide at either locus. After bonferroni adjustment for 10 tests, there was no association at p < 0.05 with neonatal anthropometric traits. . we observed no evidence of interaction between fetal genotype and maternal glucose levels on offspring birth weight, fat mass , or skinfold thickness ( p > 0.05 ) after multiple testing correction ( supplementary fig . we have shown for the first time associations between variants at the gck and tcf7l2 loci and continuous ogtt measures of maternal glucose in pregnant women without overt diabetes. The gck rs1799884 variant was associated with fasting glucose in both study populations. Mutations of the glucokinase gene result in a raising of glucose values throughout the glucose tolerance test compared with non mutation - carrying family members. In keeping with this, gck rs1799884 was associated with higher 1-h glucose levels in the european population in our study. The tcf7l2 rs7903146 variant showed associations at p < 0.05 with all measures of maternal glucose. Maternal gck and tcf7l2 genotypes might add useful information for predicting neonatal birth weight, skinfold sum, and percent body fat. Using roc curves , we found that maternal genotypes did not improve the discriminatory ability of the models. This may reflect that genotypes at these variants explain only a small proportion ( < 1% ) of variance in maternal glucose levels. 16 genetic variants are now known to explain 34% of the variation in fasting glucose in europeans.\",\n",
       " 'the carney complex ( cnc) is a rare dominantly inherited syndrome characterized by skin pigment abnormalities, endocrine over activity and cardiac myxomas. About 600 patients worldwide have been reported by the national institute of health ( nih ) - mayo clinic ( usa ) and the cochin centre ( france ) by january 2008. The following case illustrates a combination of the two rare diseases clinically presenting with a cerebral stroke and an extremely rapid recurrence of the left atrial myxoma in a teenager. The patient had a de novo carney complex diagnosed after an extremely short recurrence period of the cardiac tumor. intracardiac tumors in the pediatric age group are rare with an incidence of 0.17% in children. Myxomas account for 6% of all pediatric cardiac tumors after rhabdomyomas ( 63% ) and fibromas ( 6% ) oma , more likely to be attributed to its underlying genetic nature , rather than incomplete surgical resection. The majority of people who suffer from.oma are more likely than not to suffer from cancer of the pancreas or other parts of the body. This is due to its genetic nature, rather than surgical failure to treat it.',\n",
       " 'The reported prevalence in the general population is 1%-9% in autopsy series1,2,3,4 and 0.5%-2% in imaging studies. The diagnostic accuracy for unruptured intracranial aneurysms has increased6 following the recent advent of non - invasive vascular imaging tools such as magnetic resonance angiography ( mra) \"Aneurysm \" was used as a wild - card search word to identify the initial candidate cases of incidental aneurysms from among the 19,171 sets of mra examinations contained in the radiology report database. Two experienced neuroradiologists ( c - wr and hWP) used mra images and medical reports to confirm the presence of an aneurym and to quantify the size and location. Aneurysm size was defined as the largest diagonal measurement seen on the maximum intensity projection images. Location was described according to the secondary artery arising from the parent artery. Patients with known intracranial aneurysms prior to mra were identified. linear regression analyses were performed to test the relation between prevalence and age in men and women. \"Aneurysm \" was used as a wild - card search word to identify the initial candidate cases of incidental aneurysms from among the 19,171 sets of mra examinations contained in the radiology report database. Two experienced neuroradiologists ( c - wr and hWP) used mra images and medical reports to confirm the presence of an aneurYSm. Of the 18,237 patients studied, 330 ( 115 men and 215 women ) had incidental aneurysms. The median age of patients with incidentalAneurysm was 63 years and the age range was 22 - 82 years. Multiple aneuryms were found in 30 patients ( 9.1% ) , including 26 patients with 2 aneurYSms each. Patients with incidental aneurysms had more frequent aneuryms than patients with a previous stroke history ( n=136) or cardiac risk ( n =29) The prevalence of aneurYSms was significantly higher in women ( 215/8,112 ) than in men ( 115/10,125 ; p=0.02 ; table 1 ; figure 2 ) and nonsignificantly higher in men.  ninety false - positive cases, in which the radiology report contained the term \" aneurysm \" in the initial search results, were recorded. The most common sites for false positives were the anterior communicating artery and the mca bifurcation. The duration of clinical follow - up ranged from 94 days to 2,641 days , and the median follow- up duration was 1,256 days. Of the 18,237 patients studied, 330 ( 115 men and 215 women ) had incidental aneurysms. The prevalence of incidental anthurysms was significantly higher in women ( 215/8,112 ) than in men ( 115/10,125 ; p=0.02 ; table 1 ; figure 2 ) and nonsignificantly higher in men aged 70 - 79 years. Aneurysm size ranged from 1.5 mm to 13 mm , and the median size was 4.0 mm. Most aneurysms ( 299/344 ; 86.9% ) were in the 2 - 7 mm category. The most common aneurYSm location was the bifurcation of the mca.  ninety false - positive cases, in which the radiology report contained the term \" aneurysm \" in the initial search results, were recorded. The causes of false positives were junctional dilatation, vascular ectasia, and broad - based focal bulging. The duration of clinical follow - up ranged from 94 days to 2,641 days. 43 of the 330 patients ( 13.0% ) were treated by clipping ( n=32 ) or coiling ( n =11 ) With the advent of less invasive vascular imaging techniques the incidental discovery of asymptomatic intracranial aneurysms is increasing. We found a prevalence of 1.8% , which is somewhat lower than previous reports. Our study was not population - based and although the patients were ethnically homogeneous , there may have been a bias in the study population. Our study represents the real - world experience of a single high - volume center with uniform non - invasive imaging. our results confirmed a higher prevalence of intracranial aneurysms in women than in men. a significant number of false - negative cases that were not identified . in light of these limitations , we urge caution in interpreting our mra prevalence rate. The prevalence of unruptured intracranial aneurysms was 1.8% in women and 1.7% in men. The most common location for false - positive cases was the anterior communicating artery. The incidence of symptomatic conversion may have been higher than 2.8%. Many of the instances of vascular ectasia and bulging contours were a consequence of poor image quality.',\n",
       " \"454 sequencing is unsuitable for studies requiring targeted sequence data from many different samples. We have developed a method called parallel tagged sequencing ( pts) that largely alleviates these problems. pts is based on a ligation strategy analogous to the one utilized in the 454 sequencing plate. The standard 454 library preparation procedure uses barcoding adapters and a restriction system that excludes background sequences. sample - specific barcodes are ligated to both ends of the molecules, and the resulting nicks are removed by a strand - displacing polymerase. half of the adapter is then cut off by srfi, which is a rare cutter in mammalian genomes. phosphatase treatment in conjunction with srfi digestion effectively reduces background sequences when starting from nebulized dna. Barcoding tags begin with either an a or t , followed by four freely chosen nucleotides and end with c or g with no homopolymers allowed. Since the 454 technique uses sequencing - by - synthesis , all g 's are incorporated in the same nucleotide flow as the last key base , and therefore do not decrease the read length. We demonstrate the power of parallel tagged 454 sequencing by shotgun sequencing six human mtdna genomes on two 16th plate regions of the gs20 platform. Double - stranded barcoding adapters were prepared by briefly heating 100 m solutions of palindromic oligos to 95c and cooling them to room temperature at a rate of 0.1c / s. adapters were ligated to the blunt end dna in separate 40 l reactions. The dna was then incubated for 20 min at 37c in 30 l reactions containing 1 thermopol buffer, 250 m of each dntp and 8u bst polymerase ( neb ) , followed by reaction purification. according to the nanodrop , purified yields were between 25 and 43 ng/l , but since we observed intrasample measurement variation of 20% , triplicate measurements were carried out to estimate mean concentrations Six human genomic dna samples and their respective mtdna genome sequences were obtained from a previous study and the ceph panel ( 10,11 ) for the replicate experiment , the mTDna genomes were amplified in two overlapping fragments. amplicons from each sample were combined in equal molar ratios to obtain roughly one microgram of dna per sample. shotgun dna libraries with a mean fragment size of 500 bp were prepared using nebulizers and chemicals. One hundred nanogram of adapter - ligated dna from each of the six samples were pooled and treated with calf intestine phosphatase in a single 40 l reaction. The library was directly sequenced on two 16th regions of a full gs20 sequencing plate without a prior titration run. raw 454 reads from the standard flow files ( sff) begin with the artificial sequence tcaggggc followed by the 6 bp barcode. Only a limited amount of variation was observed for the sequence representation among samples. As little as 3% of the sequences obtained from both runs could not be assigned to a correct sequence tag. 260 of the 44 016 sequences generated in both runs carried tag sequences that differed by at least one substitution from the tags that were used. All positions of the mtdna genomes were covered by at least one sequence read, except for 3 bp from one of the 12 sequences. In 99kb of sequence four substitutions were detected between the sanger and the 454 consensus sequences, corresponding to more than 99.99% agreement. We observed single base - pair insertions or deletions at a frequency of 0.27% on average. indel rate estimates derived from previous 454 genome sequencing projects are lower ( 1,8,9 ) but in - depth comparisons are difficult due to the different natures of the sequenced genomes.  pts enables targeted dna sequencing at a lower price per nucleotide. optimal use of this technique can drastically reduce sequencing costs compared to traditional sanger sequencing. A single run of the gs20 platform can currently provide sequences for more than 50 mtdna genomes at 20-fold coverage.  pts can be readily adapted to any existing experimental design and enables sequencing any type of double - stranded dna from multiple samples. decreasing the cost per nucleotide . decreasing the number of nucleotide bases needed to sequence a DNA sequence. reducing the cost of sequencing DNA from multiple DNA samples.\",\n",
       " \"Forensic odontology / forensic dentistry is defined as that branch of forensic medicine which deals with the proper handling and examination of dental evidence. Digital imaging makes it very easy for the operator to adjust or modify digital image files. Many such manipulations constitute inappropriate changes to original data and can be classified as scientific misconduct. Digital image records of forensic data ( casts, lip prints , bite marks ) were manipulated using freely available softwares. The tools employed on images for manipulation are listed together with their function in table 1. It was quite evident that ostentatious digital images can be created either by merging two or more digital images or by altering an existing image. Digital image modification is done at a pixel level and makes it to a large extent undetectable when viewed with a naked eye. Several measures help in detection of altered digital images : look for evident anomalies in the photo. If there is doubt about integrity of images, then the images can be submitted to a proficient image processing lab. A digital watermark is a super impose on a digital photo ( consisting of text / logo / copyright notice ) . A digital composite of two people can be detected by measuring differences in the direction to the illuminating light sources from their faces and body. If there is doubt about integrity of images and previous steps did n't detect the same , then the images can be submitted to a proficient image processing lab. The purpose of a watermark is to recognize the work and discourage its unauthorized usage. digital imaging has provided scientists with new prospects to obtain and manipulate data. There is a possible use of retouched images for fraudulent purposes even in forensic investigations. computer alertness , especially about imaging software 's , should be promoted among forensic odontologist / dental professionals.\",\n",
       " 'The evaluation of tooth movement has been possible by superimposition of lateral cephalograms. Palatal rugae has been suggested as relatively stable structures for registration of serial maxillary models. 3-dimensional ( 3d ) computed tomography ( ct ) , 3d surface scanning technology, computer - aided design and associated software have contributed to the evaluation of treatment results. No accurate and reproducible method has been introduced to date to evaluate the degree of 3d orthodontic tooth movement on the mandibular dental arch despite the available technology. The method was designed to use the basal bone area as the reference for superimposition while soft tissue or alveolar bone areas were avoided since they can be altered throughout treatment. The mandible was segmented by rapidform 2006 from the craniofacial skeleton image ( figure 2 ) . orapix scanner ; a 3d surface scanning system with a slit laser beam and non - contact measurement method ( kod-300 ) was used to obtain 3d data from the dental cast model. Both pre - treatment and post - treatment orthodontic 3d digital models are shown in figure 3. The center of each foramen was selected with a grid on the monitor by picking 4 points of the foramen. The landmarks were established and selected on the 3d digital model image by 2 investigators using the rapidform program. The final coordinate values ( x , y , and z ) of each landmark were transferred to microsoft office excel 2007. The dentition was extracted from the superimposed image and the base of the model previously removed was added again on the dentition. The mean values and variances of each x- , y- , and z - coordinate values of the post - treatment landmarks were calculated. The null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis were expressed as h0 : p < s and ha : p > s. The difference in variance between the 2 superimposition methods was 0 at a significance level of 0.05.

The difference in variance between the 2 superimpositions methods was 0 at a significance level of 0.05. The final superimposed 3d digital models were produced ( figure 13 ) to permit the evaluation of tooth movement visually and numerically. 3d superimposition with 3d digital models on the maxillary arch has been developed with reliable reference areas. cbct has been adopted for 3d virtual surgical planning and simulation of post - operative outcomes in orthognathic surgery with various registration methods. The study was limited to a non - growing patient who did not undergo an orthognaths surgical procedure. We used a plaster cast scanned with an orapix scanner for the registration of the cbct scans and the 3d dental surface images. The technique introduces new sources of error because several additional steps accompanying the data acquisition and registration procedures are required. In a single patient, accuracy levels of 0.66 and 0.56 mm for the mandible and maxilla were achieved with a modified double ct scan procedure.  surface - to - surface matching ( best - fit method ) included a least square technique. This approach is advantageous in that it can be applied with no additional fiducial markers. Plane superimposition was designed to include more information concerning anatomical structures. The landmarks used - mental foramen and lingual foramen - are known as relatively stable structures.  surface method demonstrated a lower sample variance than the plane method within a 5% significance level at 28 coordinates. our results also show improved reproducibility with the automated superimposition technique. because it is almost fully computerized except for the selection process of the registration area , it avoids human error. imposition methods was calculated on each axis. mean x, y, and z values were deduced from 3d coordinates. distances of each result from the corresponding mean values were calculated. then the mean distance distribution and mean values that were generated from the 2 superimpositions methods were analyzed. future studies should include more patient samples for the superimposition procedures. ic tooth movement in non - growing patients. It is expected to gain acceptance as the new method helps patients to better understand the 3d changes in the mandibular dental arch throughout the treatment process. The visualization of 3d superimposition and measurements can help orthodontists to better evaluate treatment outcomes.',\n",

In multivariable cox regression analyses for the cer as a continuous variable , the cer remained strongly and inversely associated with all - cause mortality. Survival worsened across decreasing tertiles of the cer ( p < 0.001 across tertiles ) ( supplementary fig . 1 ) . In the final model, the cer was associated with both cardiovascular ( 0.49 [ 0.330.73 ] ) and noncardiovascular mortality. The cer was a strong inverse determinant of risk for all - cause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy. This is the first time the cer was reported to be inversely associated with mortality in diabetic patients. The cer may reflect physical activity and good health. The cer was inversely associated with all - cause mortality in diabetic patients with nephropathy. insulin resistance and physical activity may play an important role in the relationship of the cer with mortality. No important differences were apparent between the patients included in the current study and the overall population in the renaal and idnt trials. Physical activity may help halt the loss of muscle mass seen in diabetes by physical activity. Further research is needed to gain more insight into the exact relationship between muscle mass and mortality. indicating that the cer can be used as a risk marker in this population. It would be of interest to see whether halting the lost muscle mass byphysical activity may improve outcomes.',\n",

At baseline, the anxiety and depression scores were statistically different between the 2 groups ( t=12.76 and t=19.05 , respectively , both p<0.01 ) after 12 weeks of anti - depression treatment, the depression symptoms in the depression group improved. The improvement of performance in depression group most benefitted from the improvement in pe ( 10.83.7 vs. 2.43.5 ) Two groups of patients showed no significant differences in gender, age, years of education, tobacco use, alcohol and coffee consumption, tumor location and stage, proportion of surgical operation , and proportion and duration of chemo- and radio - therapy. Body mass index ( bmi) difference between the 2 groups reached statistical significance. As the chinese population ages , cancer has become one of the biggest killers of middle - aged and elderly people. depressive symptoms in cancer patients are common. This study aimed to explore the impact of anxiety and depression on executive function and quality of life in advanced cancer patients. We found that the comorbidity rate of advanced cancer and major depressive disorder can be as high as 70.5%.  sertraline is a first - line ssri anti - depressant with definite therapeutic effect and improves cognitive function   and pain. The mechanism is to inhibit the reuptake of serotonin on the presynaptic membrane to increase the function of monoamine neurotransmitters. After 12 weeks of sertRALine treatment, hama and hamd scores in the depression group greatly decreased. Cancer patients are not only impaired physically , but also psychologically. Early discovery and treatment of cancer patients depressive symptoms and pain symptoms not only improves patient mood, but also executive functions and quality of life.

The erratic clinical course has impelled research into biomarkers that could delineate disease severity and outcome.  multinucleated giant cells . cd4 t helper cells are interspersed in the granuloma while cd8 t cells, regulatory t cells , fibroblasts , and b cells surround the periphery. birefringent crystals , hamazaki - wesenberg , schaumann bodies , and asteroid bodies may also be present but are nonspecific.  ppar promotes macrophage il-10 production which inhibits the release of tnf , il-12 and matrix metalloproteinase ( mmp ) from dcs. mmps cause lung damage and fibrosis and the chemokines attract more tcells and myeloid cells into the inflammatory milieu. persistent granulomatous inflammation can be attributed to the inability of the immune regulatory mechanisms to limit the duration of the inflammatory process. The majority of studies have used the th1/th2 model to explain the immunopathogenesis of sarcoidosis. By focusing solely on this model , there is a propensity to oversimplify the immunological process and divert research efforts away from other mechanisms. High levels of il-17/cd4 t lymphocytes have been found in the balf and granulomas of patients with active disease. nkt cells produce th1 and th2 cytokines ( ifn and il-4 ) Sarcoidosis is a combination of genetic polymorphisms , the host 's immune status , and exposure to environmental agents. Both family and genetic host studies have recognised genes that are responsible for this genetic susceptibility. Butyrophilin - like 2 ( btnl2 ) is a costimulatory molecule within the mhc locus. Sarcoidosis is an antigen - driven disorder. There is a subpopulation of t cells ( av2s3 ( v2.3 ) cd4 t cells ) from balf of hla - dr0301 patients which is unique to sarcoidotic patients. It has been shown that the amount of av2S3 balf t cells at the onset of sar coidosis correlates positively with prognosis. Numerous pathogens have been implicated and investigated in the etiology of the disease. After stimulation, more t cells express th1 than th2 cytokines in both the balf and peripheral blood of sarcoidosis patients. Only 80% and 40% of cd4 il-4 cells concurrently produce ifn and il-2 respectively. Th17 cells have a systemic role in patients with non - lfgren 's disease.  exhaled breath condensate ( ebc) has been subjected to intensive research as it provides a noninvasive alternative for sampling the airway and alveolar space. During exhalation, water evaporation droplets and volatile molecules diffuse as gases from the alveoli and bronchi to the mouth. Nonvolatile molecules ( e.g. , leukotrienes , prostanoids , urea , and cytokines ) condense via a refrigeration device to give ebc. A number of immunological biomarkers have been recognised in ebc but there exists no sufficiently sensitive and specific marker for diagnosing and predicting the prognosis of sarcoidosis. No ideal markers for detecting and monitoring the clinical course of sarcoidosis exist. ebc has advantages over bal ( it is noninvasive , requires little instrumentation , does not introduce foreign substances into the lung or cause inflammatory changes ) but the lack of reliable markers and the inability of ebc to sample specific compartments of the lungs undermine these benefits. Despite nearly 140 years of extensive research , the aetiology and pathogenesis of sarcoidosis and the mechanisms that regulate the immune reactions in the peripheral blood remain undetermined. Given its variable clinical manifestation and the lack of a reliable diagnostic test with uniformed reference values and measurements , diagnosing sarcoIDosis remains a clinical conundrum for many physicians.\",\n",

       " 'grip strength indicates the ability of hand muscles to grip. A decrease in grip strength makes it difficult for subjects to use their hands for many daily activities. Recovery from this muscle weakness is a major goal of rehabilitation. adhesive taping has been used as a therapeutic modality. It is clinically effective in reducing pain and improving joint movement. The true effect of taping on muscle strength remains unclear. We hypothesized that application of both tapes can improve muscle strength by facilitating contraction. A total of 20 healthy adults participated in this study. Subjects were asked to grip the handle of the dynamometer with maximum effort for 3  s with a one - minute break between trials. The tape was applied on the dominant hand based on the edinburgh handedness inventory. The muscle and tissue were placed in a stretched position. All subjects were asked to perform elbow joint extension with wrist joint flexion while the tape was being applied. No significant difference was found in the maximum grip strength between the two groups. The use of adhesive tape is gradually increasing in the clinical field. This study examined the effects of two tapes with different elastic properties on maximal grip strength. In the nt group, there was no significant difference in the maximal  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 grip strength ( z=0.354 , asymp). No effective change in maximal grip strength was noted immediately following the application of nt. alexander et al.12 , 15 suggested that if the muscle is held in a shortened position by the tension of the tape, there may be reduction in tonic muscle spindle activity. Different taping application techniques with different tensions and different forms can provide different tactile stimuli. Taping techniques are used in clinical practice in order to achieve various  therapeutic effects. There is limited evidence regarding the effects on muscle strength. We believe our research will provide guidelines for  clinical practice for use in subjects who need to increase their muscle strength with use of the tape.',\n",

The selection of candidate plant genomes for complete sequencing is based on the scientific and anthropocentric value of the plant and the feasibility of a meaningful sequencing and assembly strategy. The 1c genome size for broad bean ( vicia faba) is at least 26  000 mb, or over eight times the size of the human genome. The opensputnik database has been designed as an interim platform for the exhaustive annotation and analysis of est sequences in a comparative context. In addition to clustering sequences , a peptide sequence is identified , thus , providing a more sensitive target for the identification of functional and structural features. sequences are placed in context with the currently available complete plant genomes and associated with other clustered est collections. The current version of opensputnik utilizes the complete public plant est collection that was available from the european molecular biology laboratory ( embl ) at the start of spring 2004. Ests were aggressively trimmed of any likely residual vector or polylinker sequences using the crossmatch application ( p. green , unpublished data ) and the national center for bioinformatics information ( ncbi ) univec database. sequences < 55 nt in length were excluded at this stage. Unigene sequences and peptides from each of the included species have been annotated using a selection of bioinformatics tools that are relevant to comparative genomics and biological understanding. sequences are annotated for structural and functional characters using interpro domains ( 16 ) , tmhmm for the identification of transmembrane domains ( 17 ) and targetp for the prediction of organellar targeting ( 18 ) The source code to the opensputnik engine and core reporting architecture is being open - sourced and released to source forge ( www.sourceforge.com ) The open-source code will be applied to novel and proprietary sequence collections as either a collaboration with , or as a service of , the bioinformatics core facility at the turku centre for biotechnology.',\n",
       " 'The prevalence of diabetes mellitus in india is roughly 7.1%. 510% of the national health budget is spent on prevention and treatment of diabetes. There are only about 1400 nephrologists in a country with a population of 1.25 billion. There is a paucity of multicentric data on survival rates of diabetic patients on maintenance hemodialysis. The aim of this retrospective analysis was to examine the survival rates of diabetic and non diabetic patients belonging to different socioeconomic groups. We retrospectively analyzed the outcome of 897 patients ( 629 males and 268 females ; mean age  standard deviation 48.69  14.27 years ) who were initiated on mhd between 2003 and 2009 at five dialysis centers. We collected the following clinical and biochemical parameters of the patients at presentation: systolic blood pressure, body mass index, hemoglobin level, serum albumin, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, serum bicarbonate, blood urea and serum creatinine. Data on events such as transplantation, transfer to continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis ( capd) and loss to follow-up were also collected as censored observations.

Of the 897 patients, 166 patients survived, 350 patients died and 234 were lost to follow - up. 137 patients had renal transplant and 10 patients were transferred to capd. 5-year survival rate was 20.7% in diabetic patients and 38.2% in non- diabetic patients. A higher age at initiation of dialysis , the presence of diabetes and a lower socioeconomic status were all associated with lower survival rates. The 5-year survival rate was 20.7% in our diabetic patients , compared with 38.2% in the non - diabetic patients. The 2014 united states renal data system reported that only 37.2% of patients with diabetic kidney disease survived 5 years after initiation of hemodialysis. survival rates of diabetic patients on mhd are poorer in india than in developed countries. The best and most cost - effective intervention that can be applied is early diagnosis and management of diabetes.  diabetic patients on mhd from lower socioeconomic groups have the poorest survival. This is due to suboptimal care for undiagnosed cardiovascular disease, poor nutritional status, irregular dialysis schedules and poor compliance to dietary restrictions and glycemic management. Patients undergoing mhd in a multispecialty hospital are seen by a nephrologist during every session. In developing countries like india the majority of patients have to cover the cost of treatment out of their own pocket. The federal government has recently declared a policy of setting up hemodialysis centers across all 650 districts in india. The dearth of trained nephrologists will be a handicap in its implementation. There is an urgent need to screen diabetics for ckd and improve awareness.',\n",
       " 'The concept that hypothermia can provide neuroprotection also has roots in the past where it was observed that infants abandoned and exposed to cold often remained viable for prolonged periods. Clinical interest in hypotheria developed in the 1930s and 1940s with case reports of successful resuscitation of drowning victims despite prolonged asphyxia.  targeted temperature management is thought to suppress many of the chemical reactions associated with reperfusion injury. hypothermia reduces the cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen by 6% for every 1c reduction in brain temperature  >  28c. rapid rewarming exaggerates neural injury partly by modulating cellular and molecular mechanisms. Conventional cooling techniques can be divided into three main categories : conventional cooling techniquessurface cooling systemsintravascular cooling systems. cold saline , crushed ice or ice bags have been used as the easiest way to induce hypothermia. Conventional cooling methods can be used as adjuncts to other more advanced cooling devices. The arctic sun surface system is superior in controlling fever in critically ill neurologic patients. The emcools cooling system uses adhesive non - invasive hypocarbon pads with a carbon - based cooling gel and provides cooling rates of 3.5c / h.

Conventional cooling methods can be used as adjuncts to more advanced cooling devices. surface cooling systems work by circulating cold fluid or cold air through blankets or pads that are wrapped around the patient. cold saline infusion has been shown to be effective in inducing hypothermia but not so effective in maintaining target temperature. volumes of up to two liters of intravenous fluids can be safely administered post - cardiac arrest.  surface systems are ease of application and rapid initiation of treatment. Most of the devices have computerized auto - feedback mechanisms allowing the user to set target temperature and the system modifies the water temperature using the feedback from patient s skin and core temperature sensors. The disadvantages of these systems are rare risk of skin burns and skin irritation.  intravascular cooling systems provide precise temperature control during maintenance and rewarming phases of temperature management. There are fewer incidences of failure to reach target temperature and less overcooling than with other systems. There is also less shivering compared to surface devices. Despite these advantages , however , there was no difference in outcome when compared with surface cooling systems. The current recommendation by ilcor is to start hypothermia as soon as possible and to aim for a temperature between 3234c. A study comparing different cooling methods in icu patients concluded that water circulating blankets , gel - pads and intravascular devices are almost equivalent for inducing hypotheria but intrav vascular devices are superior in maintaining target temperature. The combination of conventional methods and automatic computer - processed feedback devices seems a safe option.',\n",

The relationship between dietary protein and dkd is less definitive with regard to the effects of the amount and source of protein on kidney outcomes. Results are limited because of variability in important aspects of study methodology.  kidney function was evaluated by iothalamate and creatinine clearance measurement at 3- to 6-month intervals. The study evaluated not only protein , but also phosphorus and sodium restrictions , which may confer independent benefits to kidney outcomes. The studies in this meta - analysis , while encouraging , had short durations and small sample sizes.  patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes followed a low - protein diet ( 0.6 g / kg / day ) or a free diet for 12 months. protein intake level resulting in a beneficial outcome was modest. weight loss indicates an imbalance of macronutrient intake , but nutrition therapy for adequacy of overall intake was lacking.

Under aseptic precautions and after the local anesthetic administration , a strip was extracted from the donor area of the scalp. during strip excision , multiple cysts were seen in the subdermal fatty layer of scalp. gross examination of the cysts revealed long hair , intact hair bulbs as well as skin tissue. The possible reason for the formation of cystic masses subdermally is the subluxation of full thickness scalp grafts. Fue should not be confused with the older punch graft excision methods. Excess use of the tumescing fluid leads to a ballooning of the subdermal layer. Use of blunt punches leads to subluxation of grafts in the sub dermis along the surrounding tissue. The punch must be used to score around the follicular unit graft till the reticular dermis. This is a refined extraction technique that needs to be mastered and performed meticulously. meticulous dissection , use of sharp punches only , and avoiding overtumescence will help avoid inadvertent subluxation.',\n",

       " 'a technique that consistently achieves accurate rotational alignment of the femoral component of the prosthesis relative to the transepicondylar axis during total knee arthroplasty ( tka ) has yet to be determined. The posterior cruciate ligament ( pcl ) is tensioned when the knee is in flexion and acts as a secondary rotational stabilizer. The hypothesis of this study was that retention of the pcl does not affect the femoran rotational alignments in tka using a gap - balance technique. Between march 2006 and august 2013, 222 tkas were performed in 210 patients. The median age of the patients was 73  years ( range 3490  years ) at the time of surgery. One hundred and four knees ( 104 patients ) received meniscal - bearing - type pcl - retaining prostheses, and 102 knees ( 102 patients) received rotating - platform - typepcl - substituting prostheses. A single surgeon ( yi) performed all the surgeries using standardized techniques. Ligament - balancing techniques were used to ensure a balanced knee with equal flexion and extension gaps. The tension of the collateral soft tissues was adjusted by adding shim plates on the tibial side of the arthroplasty if the space was too large. Biplanar computed radiography ( cr ) images of the lower extremities were obtained before and 3 weeks after tka. 3d digital bone and component models were projected onto the biplanar cr images using the camera calibration technique. Matching the silhouettes of these digital models to the contours of the respective bone images and component cr images allowed computation of the 3d position and alignment of the components relative to the femur and tibia. Cross - sectional views in the axial plane of the femoral component of a prosthesis used in tka are shown. Postoperative femoral rotation angle ( fra) is the angle between posterior condylar line ( dotted line ) and transepicondylar axis. The tibial cut angle ( tca) was defined as the angle. between the mechanical axis of the tibia and the transverse axis. of the knee joint after tka. The range of fra was 10.8 ( 4.9 internal rotation to 5.9 external rotation ) in the pcl - retaining implant group and 9.9 (4.9internal rotation to. 5.0 external rotation) in thepcl - substituting group. One unacceptable surgical outlier was found in the retaining group, and no outliers were found for the substituting groups. Both implant designs showed comparable or greater accuracy of rotational placement compared with previous studies using the gap technique. The results can not be generalized to all knee arthroplasty patients because only mobile - bearing designs were evaluated. The pcl - retaining and -substituting femoral prostheses used here have the same geometry in medial and lateral condyle. No significant differences in the clinical results   or the coronal soft tissue balance in extension   and flexion   of knee arthroplasties using both implant designs were found in our previous studies using the same procedure performed by the same surgeon ( yi ) The median value of the fra in pcl - retaining designs was 1.1 and in pCl - substituting designs was 0.1 , with an approximately 10 range and no significant difference between the implant designs. Only one out of 104 cases in which the pcl- retaining implant was used showed over 5 of fra error. Several advantages of using the gap - balancing technique support the results of the present study. Further studies using a combination of the gap technique and the measuring technique could further improve femoral component placement precision relative to the transepicondylar axis. retention of the pcl does not affect the accuracy of femoral rotation alignment in the current design of mobile tka.',\n",
       " 'Interparticle attractions between spherical colloidal particles may cause systems to crystallize , glassify , phase separate in two differently concentrated fluids or undergo aggregation into fractal structures and gels. The degree of solvent penetration in the polymer coat plays an important role for the attraction and that grafted polymers may undergo dramatic structural changes as a function of temperature. A simple semibatch emulsion polymerization of methoxy - peg2000 acrylate macromonomer and heptafluorobutyl methacrylate results in highly monodisperse pegylated spheres. This is the first time slow feeding of initiator has been used as a route toward monod isperse core  shell spheres. The rationale for the slow feeding  initiator is to favor propagation by cutting down on radical  radical termination including peg peg termination. The initiator, potassium persulfate ( kps ) was obtained  from sigma - aldrich and was recrystallized in water once prior to use. sodium bisulfite and dodecane ( 99% ) were used as received. colloidal gold particles ( nist ) and sucrose ( fluka) were used for purification. dialysis tubes with a cutoff mw of 1214 kda from makab were used. dynamic light scattering ( dls ) and electrophoresis  measurements were performed. Colloidal gold particles with a nominal diameter of 60 nm were used to quantify the density gradient.

The effect of sodium bisulfite , often used to form a redox pair initiation system with kps, was also evaluated.  synthesized particles were characterized regarding size and degree of monodispersity by cryo - tem, saxs, and dcp. particles were synthesized using a molar ratio of x = 0.05 ( latex l5 ) Figure 2 shows the scattered intensity from a dilute dispersion of grafted phfbma of molecular weight 2000. The particles are quite monodisperse. The solvated peg graft indeed does not contribute to the saxs intensity. The thickness can be estimated from figure 3 to about 6 nm , which corresponds roughly to 6% of the mean particle radius. The peg layer is significantly elongated beyond the expected dimension of a mushroom structure. The solid line is a model fit using homogeneous spheres with a mean radius of 95 nm and a 3% polydispersity and taking smearing effects due to beam collimation into account. The interactions between the pegylated particles can be tuned through the addition of salt. electrophoresis measurements of the zeta potential show that the particles behave as charged spheres at sufficiently low ionic strengths.  particles exhibited long - time stability in 0.5 m solutions of na2co3, but aggregated in  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 0.6 m solutions. Once aggregated, particles can be redispersed. Neither the change in stirring rate nor the addition of sodium bisulfite had a significant effect on the zeta potential. A simple semibatch emulsion polymerization procedure has been employed to produce very nearly monodisperse fluorinated spheres with a well- defined peg graft without the aid of surfactants. The high degree of stability in salt solutions, the peg layer thickness, and the reversible nature of aggregation suggest that a high grafting density is reached in the synthesis. The near size monodispersity , and the single peg - layer graft should make the latices useful as model systems in a range of studies.',\n",
       " \"The pediatric cervical spine is widely variable between individuals due to the ossification process and synchondroses. A more comprehensive understanding of the cervical spine during early childhood would provide physicians with better tools to properly deal with pediatric spinal diseases. To provide normal values of the growth pattern of the pediatric cervical spinal canal and vertebral body , the present study used computed tomography ( ct ) scans of the neck or cervical spine. The local research ethics committee waived the need for formal ethics approval for this retrospective study. For measurements of the vertebral body height and antero - posterior ( ap ) diameter of the sub - axial spine ( c3 - 7 ) , the mid - body was used as the reference. To assess the effects of spinal curvature on the spinal canal space , pediatric patients were classified into groups as follows. The data were analyzed according to gender and according to age ( i , ve , e , and c ) scheffe 's multiple comparison tests were used to compare the statistical significance between the i, ve, e and c age groups. Analysis of variances, chi - square tests, unpaired t - tests, contrast tests ( orthogonal polynomial ) and pearson correlation coefficient tests were performed. The mean ages of the i, ve, and e groups were 14.15.9 months , 44.410.1 months , and 78.39.7 months , respectively. The distribution of normal weight population was almost even among the four age groups ( p>0.05 ) table 1 showed the measured value of vbh , vbap , and scap according to the age groups. The growth of c7 vbh was slightly larger than other sub - axial spines ( 3.2 mm ) The mean scap value ranged from 10.6 mm ( c4 , i group ) to 13.3 mm (c7 , c group ) in all patients. The mean sub - axial angle ( c3 - 7 ) was 7.910 mm ( range : -17 - 47 mm) traumatic event did not influence the spinal curvature in our study. The c3 - 7 angle was negatively correlated to age ( r=-0.22 ) . spinal growth generally matures by about 8 years of age. The difference between the c3 and c7 vertebrae increased very slightly with age. Vertical growth of the sub - axial body was very closely related to vertebral body axial expansion according to the pearson correlation coefficient scores.  vertical growth of the entire cervical column was not significantly different between boys and girls. The vbap dimensions were increased approximately 3.4 mm ( 3.2 - 3.6 mm ) throughout the age groups ( from infancy to 10 years ) at all sub - axial levels. The mean difference between the c3 and c7 levels decreased slightly with age. Scap increments at each cervical level were about 1.8 mm ( range : 1.6 - 2.1 mm ) from the infant stage through the pediatric stage ( less than 10 years) canal expansion in the middle upper cervical vertebrae ( c3 , 4 ) continuously increased after 8 years of age. scap dimension increased from c3 to c7 in the present study , irrespective of age ( table 1) Cervical spinal curvature did not directly contribute to dynamic change in the spinal canal in pediatric patients. The ratio of the sagittal diameter of the cervical canal to that of vertebral body was first proposed by pavlov et al. as an indicator of the degree of developmental canal narrowing. No significant changes in the tr were found at any point from infancy to early childhood in the present study. The height and axial expansion growth in the sub - axial spine was smaller than we expected. The degree of spinal canal increments ( 1.8 mm ) was much less than the dimensions of the vertebral body. The vertical length of the whole cervical column was not significantly different between boys and girls.\",\n",

The frequency of oa in those who manufacture them remains unclear. While prevalence estimates of around 10% have been reported, clinical experience suggests a far less common problem. Each of the four cases was involved in the primary manufacture or formulation of antibiotics in the united kingdom. Three worked with penicillins and their derivatives and the fourth with a variety of medicines including erythromycin. all four patients underwent single - blind , controlled specific provocation testing using a dust - tipping method. following diagnosis , each patient avoided further exposure at work to the causative antibiotic with improvement or resolution of their symptoms. 11 cases are summarised in table 2 with supporting evidence from specific provocation testing in ten. serum and skin prick tests of immunological sensitisation were only occasionally positive [ 15 , 19 , 20 ] The remaining eight reported cases developed oa during the manufacture of antibiotics other than penicillins or cephalosporins. Most have been in workers exposed to the macrolide spiramycin. We identified seven reports of epidemiological studies carried out in antibiotic manufacturing sites. In several cases , the absence of detailed information on the size of the exposed populations precludes any estimate of disease prevalence. We surveyed 91 italian workers exposed to cephalosporins with a combination of a symptoms questionnaire, skin prick and intradermal testing, and on - off testing of asthma symptoms and pulmonary function. Phenylglycine acid chloride ( pg - ac) is a highly reactive compound used chiefly in the manufacture of ampicillin and other antibiotic side chains. In the absence of any clear information on the population at risk , a prevalence estimate is not available. In italy, a 12-year prospective study of 305 workers in a spiramycin - manufacturing plant suggested work - related asthma in 15 ( 5% ) 37 cases of allergic oa. were reported to a uk national surveillance scheme between 1989 and 2009 ( thor personal communication ) . an examination of published findings from surveillance schemes in other parts of the world found specific reference to antibiotics in none. In most cases of isolated early asthmatic responses to specific provocation each of the implicated antibiotics had a very high hazard index.  penicillins and cephalosporins are common causes of oral drug allergy. In most cases is attributed to an ige - associated immune response to one or more hapten - protein conjugates. The value of available tests for evidence of immunological sensitisation in this context remains unclear. Sastre et al. reported the case of a patient with oa attributed to cefadroxil, a cephalosporin that shares a side chain with amoxicillin. While the evidence base is weak , and we can not exclude the possibility of bias in those selected for oral challenge or in publication , we suggest that there is sufficient experience to advise that patients with oA from an inhaled antibiotic encountered at work should avoid taking the same drug by mouth unless its safety has been established by a carefully supervised provocation test.',\n",
       " 'Treatment for alcoholism can be performed either within an inpatient hospital setting or as an outpatient program. over the last 30 years there has been a gradual increase of residential rehabilitation programs for alcohol disorders in italy. The therapeutic approach is inspired by both american experience of the minnesota model,9 croatian psychiatry studies,10 and finally by german and austrian psychosomatic clinics. The objective was to examine associations between sociodemographic factors and severity of alcohol dependence and psychiatric symptoms. The study sample comprised 560 hospitalized patients who had completed the rehabilitation program. The scientific and technical committee of the care and research institute of tradate ( varese , italy ) , salvatore maugeri foundation irccs approved the study on july 11, 2014. A multiprofessional intervention ( medical, nursing , psychological , educational ) evaluation and treatment of acute withdrawal symptoms. group therapy to support and maintain the motivation to change , to educate on alcohol - related risks , and to promote the activation of interpersonal skills. group activities with various modes of expression , such as movie discussions , gymnastics , theme - based groups ( ie , managing emotions , self - esteem promotion) personal involvement in the care of the patients , as well as taking care of themselves and their environment. The cba - oe was the questionnaire used to evaluate psychological treatment effects during the residential program. The questionnaire has 80 items and uses a 5-point scale , ranging from 1= nothing to 5= a lot. The self - administered questionnaire was compiled on admission to the rehabilitation program and again 3 days before discharge. We identified within the group of alcoholics in treatment some specific patient categories. The sample comprised 560 hospitalized patients who had completed the rehabilitation program. The significance in cba - oe score changes between admission and discharge was tested using the wilcoxon matched - pairs signed - rank test ( nondirectional , =0.05 ) The size effect was also calculated using cohen s d - method. Group therapy to support and maintain motivation to change and educate on alcohol - related risks. Group activities with various modes of expression, such as movie discussions, gymnastics, theme - based groups. Personal involvement in the care of the patients, as well as taking care of themselves and their environment. group meetings with family members ( if available ) with functions of support , counseling , and involvement in rehabilitation program. The cba - oe was the questionnaire used to evaluate psychological treatment effects during the residential program. The questionnaire has 80 items and uses a 5-point scale , ranging from 1= nothing to 5= a lot. The self - administered questionnaire was compiled on admission to the rehabilitation program and again 3 days before discharge. We identified within the group of alcoholics in treatment some specific patient categories. The cba - oe questionnaire is an ordinal scale of measurement. We used the mann whitney u - test or kruskal  wallis test to match nonparametric variables. Bonferroni correction was used for multiple comparisons. The size effect was also calculated using cohen s d - method. The interviews conducted at 6-month follow-up provided only a qualitative analysis. There were differences between the pure abuser and polyabuser groups on all five scales of the cba - oe at admission and at discharge. The main psychotherapeutic approaches adopted by rehabilitation facilities were psychological group therapy , individual psychological therapy ( if necessary ) , educational intervention , and different forms of expressive activity. The primary outcome of the study was the improvement in psychological functioning of patients who had completed residential treatment. The scores obtained on the scales of anxiety , depression , and psychological distress were all diminished. The results are in agreement with the current literature that shows that negative effects , including depressive states , decrease as a result of withdrawal treatment. Polyabuser group at admission had the lowest values on the scales of well - being and positive change. This group included alcohol - dependent patients also addicted to other substances. Women had the worst scores on the scale of anxiety and depression. A lower level of education was associated with higher levels of psychological distress. Social status offers a more complete understanding of the development of alcohol dependence. Social stress experienced by upper - class students may result in substance abuse to cope with the social pressure. Both pharmacological and psychological interventions were effective in the recovery of the dimension of well - being and in the capacity of change in patients with more severe psychological symptoms. The changes in anxiety disorders and depression in the current study are comparable to those in the literature. The observation of a high risk of relapse for patients who suffer from a comorbid alcohol problem and a mood disorder suggests that a psychological outcome evaluation should be included in residential detoxification - treatment programs. This could be useful in identifying subjects needing further psychosocial support after discharge.',\n",
       " 'dietary nitrate ( no3) supplementation has become popular in light of recent studies documenting its ergogenic effects on exercise economy / efficiency and endurance performance. nitrate supplementation is believed to be the result of increased nitric oxide ( no ) bioavailability following a series of reductions in the entero - salivary and peripheral circulatory systems. It is unknown if a similar effect would be observed if subjects were allowed to self - regulate their work rate to maintain a constant perceived intensity. In this study , we used an rpe clamp model to determine the effects of acute dietary nitrate supplementation - in the form of beetroot juice - on self - regulated exercise performance. We used a double - blind , placebo - controlled , crossover design. Based on an a priori power analysis using data from previous beetroot Juice studies , a sample size of ten subjects was targeted. Rpe clamp protocol to evaluate the effect of dietary nitrate supplementation using a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , counter balanced , crossover design. Subjects were blinded to all external feedback , except for elapsed time and were instructed to adjust resistance and pedal cadence as needed to maintain the appropriate level of intensity. Ten volunteers were recruited from classes at the university of colorado colorado springs ( uccs) who preformed three repeated trials on separate days without dietary nitrate supplementation. paired t - tests were used to test the hypotheses that beetroot juice would reduce total vo2 ( l ) , or alternatively , increase similarly. significance was inferred at p < 0.05. Subjects were blinded to all external feedback, except for elapsed time and were instructed to adjust resistance and pedal cadence as needed to maintain the appropriate level of intensity. resting systolic , diastolic and mean blood pressures were measured using an automated sphygmomanometer. resting heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation were assessed by finger pulse oximetry ( nellcor n-200 ) All ten subjects completed the beetroot juice trials. One subject data for the remaining nine subjects ( age 24  3 years; height 166  8 cm; weight 60  11 kg ; vo2peak 36.1  4.7 ml / kg / min ) were analyzed. beetroot. juice lowered resting systolic blood pressure relative to. placebo prior to exercise ( 107  13 vs. 112  14 mmhg , p = 0.041 ; figure 1 ) , but did not. affect resting diastolic ( 62  8 vs. 64  9mmhg ) , or mean arterial pressures ( 77  9 vs. 80  10 mmhG ) . There were no differences in resting hr ( Beetroot juice (12.9 mmol nitrate) reduced resting systolic blood pressure and vo2 ( l / min ) at a fixed work rate ( 75 w ) , 3. It did not improve performance measured during the rpe 13 clamp protocol. Because the effects of beetroot juice were small , they may have been masked by daily variation in the metabolic response to self - regulated exercise. There are several studies that have shown positive effects from single doses of beetroot juice comparable to those used in our study. We are confident that a sufficient dose was given and maintained throughout the protocol because we saw evidence of efficacy before and after the rpe clamp protocol. We believe that the small effect beetroot Juice has on vo2 may have been masked by the ~8% daily variation in total vo2 across the trial discussed above. Because subjects varied their work rate to maintain an rpe of 13 , periods of steady - state vo2 were not observed. Our subjects were recreationally active females with vo2peak values of ~35 ml / kg / min assessed at an elevation of 1950 m. There does not seem to be a differential response to beetroot juice between sexes , but this remains to be rigorously tested. Although the sample size was sufficient to detect the effects of nitrate supplementation on resting blood pressure and vo2 at a fixed work rate , it may have been insufficient to detect effects during rpe 13 clamp protocol.',\n",

       " 'We describe the use of a rotational conjunctival flap in the closure of a large defect following bleb excision. A 68 -year - old white male had undergone a limbus - based trabeculectomy with an anti - fibrotic 12 years prior in the left eye. He complained of persistent bleb dysesthesia despite frequent lubrication. The conjunctival flap was sutured to the nasal aspect of the conjunctiva remaining after excision of the bleb. The resulting linear tangential defect was closed in a running fashion using 9 - 0 polyglactin. The flap was secured at the 12 oclock limbus using 9-0 polyglACTin. Two horizontal mattress sutures of 9- 0 poly glactin were placed through the conjuctiva at the limbus to prevent corneal migration of the flap. unctival 5-fluorouracil injection was given. At 2 months post - operatively, a large bleb was present. At 7 months, the patient demonstrates a large thick - walled bleb and iop measures 10 mmhg [ figure 1b ] The rotational autograft can be closed with minimal tension as long as sufficient subconjunctival dissection has been performed. This technique could be useful in eyes where excision of the bleb creates a defect too large for primary closure. It could also be used in patients with glaucoma drainage procedures in both eyes or in patients who may require future glau coma surgery in the fellow eye.',\n",
       " 'sugammadex is a modified -cyclodextrin specifically designed to encapsulate rocuronium and chemically similar aminosteroidal muscle relaxants. The underlying mechanism of action is new and differs completely from that of acetylcholine esterase inhibitors. gammadex selectively reverses steroidal neuromuscular blockade. affinity for cortisone, hydrocortisone , aldosterone has been extensively studied. affinity is 120 fold less than for rocuronium . affinity for atropine , verapamil , ketamine is 400 to 700 fold lower. toremifene and flucloxacillin are the only molecules known to displace roCuronium or vecuronIUM from sugammades. Deep neuromuscular block ( post - tetanic count : 1 or 2 ) can be rapidly and safely reversed with sugammadex in humans. With 4 or 8 mg / kg , a 0.9 tof ratio could be obtained in 3.3 min ( range 2.2 - 4.7 min ) and 1.5 min ( 1.0 - 2.1 min ) respectively. gammadex should to be evaluated versus the routine use of conventional anticholinesterase agents. Recovery of shallow levels of neuromuscular block ( at least 2 responses at the tof at the adductor pollicis ) following neostigmine is not as fast as usually thought. There has always been an unsatisfied need for a reversal agent that can rapidly reverse neuromuscular block regardless of its depth. sugammadex or neostigmine was given when no responses at the tof at the adductor pollicis could be detected. A 0.9 tof ratio was attained in 2.9 min with sugamadex versus 50.4 min in patients receiving nestigmine - glycopyrrolate.  wall muscles which are resistant to the effects of nmba [ 28 - 30 ] when compared with peripheral muscles such as the adductor pollicis until the very - end of the procedure. However in this kind of situation , the anesthetist should remember that the requested dose of sugammadex will be 4 and not 2 mg / kg. Nmba can cause anaphylactic reaction because quaternary ammonium ions are suggested to be the allergenic determinants in nmbas. Cross reactivity can be observed even between steroidal and benzylisoquinoline nmba. The use of sugammadex to capture rocuronium and to be an adjunct in the management of roCuronium - induced anAPHylactic complication has been suggested. For the first time we have a molecule that can reverse easily and rapidly any level of vecuronium - induced neuromuscular block when given at the appropriate dose. It would become possible to reverse the block exactly when needed and no residual paralysis should be observed anymore in the recovery room. Based on the studies , it is recommended to use 2.0 mg / kg for reversing a shallow roCuronium block.',\n",

       " 'The new zealand census - mortality study is a population - wide cohort study. The cohort consists of the entire 1996 resident population ( n=3  732  000 ) and the outcome of interest is mortality. For this analysis, records from the 1996 census were anonymously linked to 3  years of subsequent mortality data. The method of record linkage has been described in detail elsewhere. 23 data on meteorological variables and indicators of air pollutant emissions for these areas were used as predictors of pm10 exposure in christchurch. The average pm10 level for all new zealand census areas was 8.3  g / m. The cut - off values between pm10 quintiles were 0.0 , 0.5 , 12.5 and 15.4  g/ m.  ethnicity and socioeconomic position are strong predictors of mortality in new zealand. These factors are potential confounders of the association of air pollution with mortality. smoking status was reported in the census using the categories : never smoker, ex - smoker , or current smoker. Social deprivation was measured by the nzdep index ( in quintiles) within small geographical areas. Census and mortality records were linked using date of birth ( day , month and year as separate matching variables ) Age was included as a linear plus a squared term , and the income variable was natural - log transformed. sensitivity analysis by restricting the dataset for analysis to those people who had lived in the same geographical unit at the 1991 census as they did at the time of exposure assignment. The method of air pollution exposure assessment has been described in detail elsewhere. The approach to modelling long - term average pm10 was as follows. atmospheric dispersion modelling results were available for one city ( christchurch , population 300  000 ) These data were assumed to be representative of the spatial pattern of annual average pm 10 exposures for small areas ( census area units ) in christchurch.  ethnicity and socioeconomic position are strong predictors of mortality in new zealand and potential confounders of the association of air pollution with mortality. We assigned each respondent to a mutually exclusive ethnic group using a prioritisation system. smoking status was reported in the census using the categories : never smoker, ex - smoker , or current smoker. We also included estimates of long - term average minimum temperature ( in addition to the above sociodemographic factors ) in the models. Logistic regression results differ very little from those from either poisson or cox proportional hazards modelling. Initial models incorporated pm10 categories as dummy variables. When pm10 was modelled using dummy variables , there was an approximately linear increase in mortality with increasing average pm10 exposure. adjusting for potential confounders in model 3 attenuated the or for all non - referent groups. The or of 1.007 corresponds to a 1 unit increase in pm10 , which equates to an increase of 7% ( 95% ci 3% to 10% ) in the odds of all - cause mortality in adults ( aged between age 30 and 74  years at census ) per 10  g / m increase in long - term average pm10 exposure. We found stronger effects of pm10 among people who lived in the same census area in 1991 ( at the time of the previous census ) , 8% ( 4% to 12% ) per10  g  increase inpm10. The association was similar for all natural causes, but substantially stronger for respiratory deaths ( including lung cancers ) and for cardiovascular disease. Using linked mortality and census data, we report a significant positive association between estimated long - term exposure to air pollution ( pm10) and mortality in new zealand urban areas. The results persist after controlling for plausible confounders, including multiple measures of socioeconomic position and smoking. There was an apparently stronger association of pm10 with all - cause mortality among maori , 20% ( 7% to 33% ) Odds of all - cause mortality in adults ( aged between 30 and 74  years at census ) increased by 7% ( 95% ci 3% to 10% ) per 10  g / m increase in average pm10 exposure. Our observations are consistent with an increasing number of studies of long - term exposure to particulate matter and mortality. There was a 5% ( 0% to 10% ) increase in mortality per 10  g / m increase in black smoke in the netherlands. mortality was most strongly associated with average pm10 exposures in the 24  months before death in the uk. A re - analysis of the american cancer society study found no clear effect of exposure period. There is evidence that more deprived populations are particularly sensitive to air pollution effects. We found an association of pm10 with mortality in a country with relatively low levels of air pollution. There was some evidence that maori may have greater susceptibility to life - shortening effects of airpollution.',\n",
       " ' quids are expectorated masses of human - masticated plant fibers commonly found at new world archaeological sites. These artifacts are frequently overlooked despite their potential importance in the interpretation of ancient diets and diseases. quid analyses have involved plant fiber identification, dental impressions , and phytolith recovery. Recovery of species - specific parasite - induced antibodies from human saliva in modern contexts begs the question : can these antibodies be recovered from archaeological materials saturated with desiccated human saliva ? to answer this question , while parasite - specific coproantigens have been demonstrated to preserve within archaeological materials like coprolites and latrine sediments , the recovery of human - created parasite- specific antibodies from archaeological material has not been attempted to date. The quids used in the present study were excavated from la cueva de los muertos chiquitos ( cmc ) , a site within the rio zape valley , in the early 1960s. T. cruzi can be traced back more than 9,000 years in the new world. This parasite is particularly interesting because prehistoric humans of the southwestern usa and mesoamerica inserted themselves into the life cycle. The incredible preservation of both physical and molecular parasite evidence makes this site ideal for testing new methods of parasite evidence recovery utilizing quids as source materials.  elisa kits for t. cruzi are designed to test human serum rather than fecal samples. To date, elisa techniques have not been applied to archaeological materials to recover evidence of t.cruzi. The origins of toxoplasmosis among humans have been more elusive than those of american trypanosomiasis. T. gondii is known to infect a wide range of endothermic vertebrate hosts, including bats, rodents, and carnivores. To date, there has been no archaeological evidence of this parasite recovered from any context. elisa kits have been developed to test modern human serum for t. gonda antibodies rather than for parasite coproantigens in fecal samples. A total of 45 quids were given a laboratory identification number ( cmcq- # ) for analysis and photographed using a sony cybershot 18.2 megapixel camera. Each of the quids was analyzed using an olympus stereoscopic microscope and designated as being comprised of either agave or non - agave fibers. Quids were rehydrated in their entirety within a plastic , conical , 50 ml centrifuge tube containing a 0.5% trisodium phosphate solution. T. gondii and t. cruzi evidence was tested at the zera lab within the school of biological sciences at the university of nebraska - lincoln. The toxoplasma iga elisa kit has a specificity of 99% and a sensitivity of 99%. The cut - off value for the chagas ( t.cruzi ) igg elisa was calculated by taking the average of the od values for the cut -off control wells. 11 previously unprocessed quids were selected from the cmc collection held within the pathoecology laboratory at unl s school of natural resources. These quid were weighed , photographed , rehydrated in 0.5% trisodium phosphate , and further processed as previously described. aliquots from each of these 22 samples were transferred into pre - labeled microcentrifuge tubes. A second aliquot of precisely 10 l from each sample was placed into microcentre tubes along with 990 l of wash buffer to test whether or not dilution of samples made a difference in the recovery of antibodies using these techniques. The siga elisa kit used was developed for determining concentration levels of siga in modern samples and not for determining presence / absence of sigas in archaeological samples. The od values for 0.5% trisodium phosphate ( 0.161 ) was subtracted from each sample od value ( i.e. the od value for the rehydration solution was used as a blank ) blank - corrected od values were then compared to the od values acquired for the kit - provided standards. The study represents the first attempt to use quids as a source material for archaeoparasitological investigations. Other studies have successfully employed elisa techniques for recovering parasite evidence from latrine and burial sediments as well as coprolites. None have successfully recovered parasite antigens or parasite - induced antibodies from quids. Quid processing methods were developed by modifying coprolite processing techniques deemed successful for the recovery of parasite coproantigens. future examinations of antibody degradation resulting from desiccation could elucidate the nature of human antibody taphonomy. future elisa tests of quids should target parasite antigens as opposed to parasite - induced human antibodies.  processing methods should be designed to inflict little damage to potential antibodies / antigens. Only kits that are highly specific / sensitive should be employed. samples should be tested quickly after being reconstituted before bacterial and fungi are able to colonize samples. archaeoparasitological data do not reflect actual infection rates in past populations with 100% accuracy.',\n",
       " 'intraperitoneal lymphangioma ( il) is a type of benign cyst with an incidence of approximately 1%. lesions often take place in mesentery , retroperitoneum. Most previously reported ils are asymptomatic and are often incidentally found through imaging investigation or during surgery for other unrelated causes. There were five children , with an age range of 415 years , and 16 adults ( 2780 years ) in our series. The analysis based on sex revealed that there was no gender predilection. The main symptom was intermittent dull abdominal pain , which could be aggravated by the erect position. Physical examination revealed an abdominal mass in 16 patients ( 76% , 16/21 ) , and of these, eight patients ( 50% , 8/16 ) could feel pain when the location of the il was pressed. The lumps of four patients were found upon routine examination , and no symptoms were present. radiological studies revealed a unilocular cyst in 16 Patients. Five multilocular masses were defined by the septae dividing the cystic spaces.  Magnetic resonance imaging showed the mass as hyperintense on t2-weighted sequences , suggesting fluid content. The size of the cysts varied from 3.67 to 18.33 cm , with an average size of 7.30  3.28 cm. The most common site of these cysts was the retroperitoneum with a medial scale of 6.6 cm. 17 ( 85% , 17/20 ) of the 20 patients were followed up with an average of 5.8 years ( 210 years ) recurrence of il at the original site occurred in two patients. therapy after the recurrence included excision of the mass together with the accretive tissues in the two individuals.  acute abdominal pain and ceasing exhaust air with nausea and vomiting was the result of intestinal obstruction secondary to mesenteric lymphangioma. The rate of symptoms in mesentery cysts was 71% and the rate was 42% in retroperitoneum masses. Younger patients were more likely to have obvious and more acute symptoms. Mri is infrequently used for the diagnosis of lymphangioma in the literatures. But it enables better preoperative evaluation of intra - abdominal cysts. These lesions may be unilocular or multilocular and contain fluid. The occurrence of these lesions is single , multiple lesions are reported to be a rare event. Of the three histological types of the lymphangioma described , all masses were determined to be cysts in our research. symptoms are stimulated by the primary mass ( 52% ) , while in a few circumstances , they are triggered by complications ( 5% ) The true incidence of il is obscure , and there appears to be no true on sex predilection. The accuracy rate of preoperative diagnosis of lymphangioma in the abdomen was 90% in our study. The boundary of the cysts and internal separate structures are well visible. It is necessary to excise segmental normal adjacent tissues that appeared to be continuous with the cyst. placement of a drainage tube after surgery is essential for preventing chylous ascites.  laparoscopy. was given more attention as a potential therapy for intra - abdominal lymphangioma. with increasing use and popularity of laparoscopic procedures. from our own perspective. We looked at laparoscope as a treatment for intra-abdominal lymphang ioma. We also looked at it as a therapy for other types of cancer.',\n",
       " ' analytical ultracentrifugation is an analytical absolute technique applying centrifugal force to fractionate the sample. optical systems that have been constructed are uv / vis absorption , rayleigh interference , schlieren and the lavrenko optics. development of new optical detection systems can expand the possible use of auc for different types of samples. ating power of the auc can yield distributions of the individual components in complex mixtures. this can start with relatively straightforward issues like sample homogeneity and purity. especially for such complex samples mwl - auc has a huge potential. spectral discrimination can synergistically enhance the hydrodynamic resolution. The purity of the sample concerning the color characteristics ( brilliance of color due to steep absorbance profiles ) is of interest for the industrial application. Any possible transitions between different structures can be advantageously solved in a single mwl - auc experiment. The -carotene product was obtained in powder form as a laboratory sample from basf se , ludwigshafen. The selected wavelength range was 250750  nm . in the prototype setup , we apply the spectrum acquired for an empty cell as a reference for the calculation of the absorption leading to a baseline offset of 0.05 od ( see fig . 3i ) after the experiment , while cleaning the cell , we saw some precipitate in the cell reservoir. thus , not all particles were transferred to the sample column, but some big particles remained in the reservoir. Auc is a multiwavelength auc as described in bhattacharyya et al . ( 2006 ) and strauss et al. The reservoir is filled with a small amount of concentrated sample. Column and sample sectors are filled with d2o with a density which is higher than that of the sample solution and lower than the density of the dispersed solute. forty scans were taken with a time interval of 90  s and a radial step size of 50  m to observe the full sedimentation. ation experiment with -carotene detected with the mwl detector. We have converted the radial position ( r ) to the sedimentation coefficient s by using eq .  1. The 3d absorption dataset can now be projected either onto the wavelength or sedimentation coefficients axis.  parameters 1 and 2 determine the optical properties and bioavailability that are decisive for the commercial application profile. For the smallest particle sizes, -carotene is an h - aggregate while for the biggest particle sizes - carotene forms j - aggregates. The buoyant density of gelatin is rather high ( above 1.3  g / cm ) and can not be matched with a non - interfering solvent. The spectrum of the composite particle indicates the -carotene j - aggregate ( auweter et al . 1999 ) It can be seen that gelatin only contributes to the uv region of the spectra below 280  nm. The contribution of gelatin is vanishing compared to the three times stronger absorption. The s - distribution of the particles is shown for 5 different representative wavelengths out of 330 ( 250750  nm with a wavelength resolution of 1.5  nm ) We conclude that there are at least three fractions in the sample : small hybrid particles with s  <  25  s , a main fraction around 100  s and larger particles around 200  s. The coloristic polydispersity is not due to an intra - particle but inter - particle distribution of morphologies. This result is contrary to the previous assumption that is sketched in fig.  2 , where h / j - aggregates would coexist in the particles. The concentration ratio between these particles determines the colour of the final sample. Industrial -carotene gelatin composite particles are a highly heterogeneous system both in particle size and chemical composition. fractionation of this mixture in mwl - auc allows to resolve individual components in the mixture and detect compositional changes in an experiment. This proves the power of mwl-auc as a direct technique that can differentiate particles with respect to size and uv / vis spectra.',\n",
       " 'The gold standard in the treatment of distal radius fracture remains uncertain. Traditional open reduction and internal fixation often results in extensive soft tissue dissection and periosteal injury. The technique of minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis ( mipo ) recently emerged and can minimize soft tissue stripping and damage to the vascularity of the bone. 22 patients with distal radial fractures were treated by the modified mipo technique with a t - shaped palmar locking plate. An informed consent was taken from the patients and the approval of the ethics committee of hand surgery hospital was obtained. Two skin incisions of 2 cm each were made [ figure 1 ] for patients with a distance between the main fracture surface and articular surface of distal radius within 1 cm. Two skin incisions of 2 cm each were made on the radial side of the flexor carpi radialis. The superficial and deep fascia was cut to retract the radial artery. The flexor pollicis longus was dissected using forceps. A suitable , oblique , t - shaped palmar locking plate was inserted through the incision. A prospective, randomized study analyzed 90 patients with displaced intraarticular distal radius fractures. The average age of the patients was 65 years ( range 37 - 80 years ) . The mean time from injury to surgery was 7 days ( range 0.5 hour-10 days ) . they were all closed fracture and were classified according to ao / asif system. Good or excellent results were achieved in 43% , 80% , and 63% in each group. pin tract infection was the major complication of external fixation of fractures and the rates of infection ranged from 0.5% to 30%. conventional closed reduction using only simple plaster cast immobilization is insufficient to maintain the reduction.  incisions to implant a palmar locking plate by mipo for distal radius fractures give good functional results. But further research also should be carried out to explore more suitable treatment for specific individuals. In the U.S. the National Institutes of Health are funding a study to find out if a similar procedure could be used in the UK.',\n",

The age of presentation of the disease has changed dramatically and the factors responsible for this change are mainly attributed to advances in diagnostic tools. Subclinical or so called silent cd cases are being detected in increasing numbers because of raised awareness of the condition. There is a need to re - define the terminologies according to the modified treatment strategy in gluten related disorders. villous atrophy is not mandatory any longer to qualify a patient for gfd. A large number of patients present with non - celiac gluten sensitivity with completely normal biopsy and negative serology. A t - cell response to gliadin precedes, and very likely produces, the complete pattern of cd. It is hard to rule out the contribution of antibodies in genesis of an autoimmune condition like cd. The screening value of autoantibodies has been too optimistically overestimated. GS patients are gluten intolerant and gluten consumption does not lead to small intestinal damage , so it is not accompanied by the concurrence of ttg autoantibodies or autoimmune disease. in some cases gs can present with normal or milder enteropathy seen as increased intestinal permeability , ibs , abdominal discomfort , pancreatic disorders , pain or diarrhoea. It may present with a variety of extraintestinal symptoms including lymphoma , attention deficit disorder and neuropathy. Treatment threshold for cases with atypical cd and those with gluten sensitivity. Life quality of these cases will improve with gfd and the long - term health benefit of this strategy would perhaps be also cost effective. Treatment threshold for. cases withAtypicalCD and those who have gluten sensitivity , as the life quality of those cases will. improve.',\n",
       " 'The primary objective of triad was to determine how structural and organizational characteristics of health systems and health care provider groups influence the processes and outcomes of diabetes care. Six translational research centers collaborated with 10 health plans and 68 provider groups that served 180,000 diabetes patients. The triad study population was a random sample of adult enrollees with diabetes from participating health plans. The eq-5d consists of two parts : five questions relating to distinct dimensions of a person s functional capacity ( mobility, self - care, usual activity, pain / discomfort , and anxiety / depression ) and a visual analog scale. because the baseline survey was conducted primarily by phone , the visual analogscale of the eq- 5d was not implemented. The responses from the eq -5d were combined with preference weights derived from a sample of the u.s. for each type of complication. Study population was nonobese man with type 2 diabetes who was not asian or hispanic, not using insulin treatment, and had an annual household income of more than $ 40,000. All statistical analyses were performed using sas 9.2 software. Of the 13,086 individuals who were contacted and eligible, 11,927 ( 91% ) completed the survey. There are three responses for each domain of the questionnaire. Because the baseline survey was conducted primarily by phone , the visual analog scale of the eq-5d was not implemented. The responses were combined with preference weights derived from a sample of the u.s. We constructed categories within each type of complication based on clinically defined disease states. All statistical analyses were performed using sas 9.2 software. The reference group was defined as a nonobese man with type 2 diabetes who was not asian or hispanic , not using insulin treatment , and who had an annual household income of more than $ 40,000. Patients with diabetes - related complications or comorbidities had lower health utility scores than those without. The most severe microvascular complications , painful neuropathy and amputations were associated with a lower score.  complications associated with a reduction of more than 0.03 in the health utility score were hemiplegia , nonpainful diabetic neuropathy , cerebral vascular accident , congestive heart failure , and dialysis. Other complications, such as other coronary heart disease , transient ischemic attack , and peripheral vascular disease were associated with relatively small reductions in eq-5d scores. nonproliferative and proliferative diabetic retinopathy did not independently reduce health utility scores and were dropped from the final model.  obesity impairs physical functioning, decreases energy levels, increases health distress, and decreases self - rated health. Our model found a higher health utility score for asians and hispanics and a lower score for women and low - income individuals. No interactions were found among any of the three variables for type of diabetes treatment or diabetes - related complications. The ceiling effect of eq-5d has been documented in other studies ( 3,4 ) . The estimated range and level of penalty scores associated with individual complications between the coffey et al. and our study varied from 0.012 to 0.108. The population included type 2 diabetic patients with a wide range of treatments, complications, comorbidities and duration of diagnosed diabetes. Health unity scores associated with diabetes and its complication can change due to improvements in physical, mental , and social functions of diabetes patients over time. Our study focused on assessing the relative decrement utility associated with each diabetes - related complication and its progression rather than the absolute level of health utility scores for those complications. Because our income level was measured in 2001 u.s. dollars , the income variable should be adjusted using an inflation calculator if income is expressed in other years. Cost - utility analysis is the type of economic evaluation most often used to assess interventions used for the prevention and control of type 2 diabetes. We derived a set of such health utility estimates using data collected in a large multicenter diabetes study using u.s .- based preference weights. Our empirically derived health utility scores will allow researchers to calculate qalys for studies involving individuals living in the U.S. with type 2 Diabetes.',\n",
       " 'The development of efficient catalytic methods for the formation of bonds between main group elements is of considerable interest for the continued development of main group chemistry. The development of this field lags substantially behind the advances made in catalytic c  c and c  x bond formation. The metal catalyzed formation of polyaminoboranes has attracted recent attention. Dehydrocoupling mechanism of secondary phosphine  boranes in solvents such as fluorobenzene. We have proposed a catalytic cycle for the dehydrocoupled of h3bpr2h ( r= ph , bu ; scheme 2 ) for this cycle, intermediate  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 species were isolated, but their structures could not be confirmed by x - ray crystallography. The mechanism of dehydrocoupling of phosphine  boranes using this catalyst is currently not known. We report an extension of our investigations into the mechanism of\\xa0 phosphine\\xa0 borane dehydrocouping using the rh(ph2p(ch2)3pph2 ) fragment. We also report for the first time the partial control of diastereoselectivity in phosphine boran dehydroc coupling with a chiral chelating phosphine. The primary phosphine compounds 2(33 ) and 3(38) are known adducts and offer electron - withdrawing and donating aryl groups. The synthesis of adamantyl - substituted phosphine , 4, has been reported in the patent literature. The new linear diboraphosphines, 1013, have also been synthesized to aid in the identification of final dehydrocoupling products.  complexes 15 and 16 could only be isolated as oils. Their characterization by nmr spectroscopy and esi - ms was fully consistent with their formulation. small amounts ( approximately 510% ) of the associated dehydrocoupling product in the solution nmr Spectra after short periods of time.  complexes 15 and 16 have similar h, b, and p nmr spectra, and thus we assign very similar structures. crystals of complex 14 of suitable quality for analysis by x - ray diffraction were obtained by layering of a 1,2-f2c6h4 solution with pentane at 26 c. The structure of 14 in the solid - state ( figure 2 ) is fully consistent with the structure deduced from the solution. b - agostic  interactions with the rh - center are known. phosphine  boranes are also known. Bimetallic complexes showing both b- agostic and borane coordination modes have been reported. Some hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity. selected bond lengths (  ) and angles ( deg ) are chosen.  complex 17 has been synthesized cleanly from direct addition of the preformed dehydrocoupled diboraphosphine product to [ rh(l)(-fc6h5)][bar4 ] , scheme 5. It was from this reaction that a material of 17 suitable for single crystal x - ray diffraction was obtained. Figure 3 shows the solid - state structure of 17. Spectroscopic data for complexes 17 and 19 are fully consistent with the solid - state structure being retained in solution. Two signals are well - resolved and show coupling to rh ,  46.6 [ j(rhp ) 111 hz ] and  12.8 [ j (rhp) 91 hz ) These signals are attributed to the chelating phosphine ligand. Dehydrocoupling reactions follow a first order rate profile for the consumption of the starting material over at least three half - lives. The parallel products 21 and 22 are formed in approximately  equal ratio to the dehydrocoupled product ( 17 and 18 ) This suggests that k1  k2 ( scheme 4) is the rate determining step in the reaction. Phenomenon of phosphine borane complexes has been noted previously in phosphine  borine complexes. 20 is a complex that sits directly between 14 and 21 by loss of one bh3 fragment ( scheme 6 ) . b bond cleavage, formally of the  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 -h3bpr2h ligand, allowed a complex to be identified. Phosphine borane complex [ rh(l)(-h3bp(adamantyl)2h)][bar4 ] , 23 was characterized in situ by nmr spectroscopy. This complex could not be isolated as it undergoes further reaction to form 24. Figure 4 shows the structure of the cation present in 24 in the solid - state. A rh(i ) center is in a pseudo - square - planar  geometry. A significant amount of p  b bond cleavage is observed for both electron poor aryl phosphine boranes ( e.g. , 14 ) and very bulky electron rich phosphine  borane  24. This is similar to the mechanism suggested for the formation of diaminoboranes from amine and amines catalyzed by alkaline earth catalysts. Reaction of [ rh(l)(-fc6h5)][bar4 ] with a slight excess of h3bpcyh2 ( 5 ) in 1,2-f2c6h4 solution led to the instantaneous formation of only two complexes in a 1:1 ratio. These new products are directly analogous to those formed with secondary phosphine  boranes ( i.e. , 14 ) , and the nmr spectroscopic data match closely. The p{h } nmr spectrum from this reaction shows 8 resonances. The phosphido signal (  21.2 ) might reflect a significant local difference in steric pressure between 25a and 25b at this group. The h nmr spectrum does not have the necessary resolution to separate out the diastereomers in the hydride region. The decomposition product [ rh(l)(ph2cy)2 ] was also observed. A mixture of the diastereomers 26a/26b and 25a/25b showed a significant change in the ratios of the two isomers. We suggest that the mechanism for equilibration involves reductive elimination of the phosphido and hydride ligands to form a rh(h) ligand. i ) phosphine  borane complex , similar to e in scheme 2 , which then undergoes rapid oxidative addition  of the other p  h bond. This must be a reversible process , leading  to a thermodynamic ratio of the diastereoisomers. Unfortunately we were unable to deduce the stereochemistry of the preferred isomer using roesy experiments or a solid - state structure. Diasteroisomers can be formed by direct addition of 13 to [ rh(bdpp)(-fc6h5)][bar4 ] Initially a 2:1:2:1 ratio of 4 isomers is observed ,  that changes to a 5:1;3:0 ratio after 18 h. We are unable to comment in more detail on the conformation of these isomers. The main product is the linear diboraphosphine. There are products that we tentatively identify as the cyclic oligomers ( bh2pr2)n ( n = 3 , 4 ) The mechanism of formation of these oligomers remains to be resolved. For electron - donating 3 the reaction is slower using the [ rh(l)(-fc6h5)]. Under melt conditions ( 90 c , \\xa05 mol % , 4 h ) h3bpphh2 is dehydrocoupled to give a major product which is identified by p nmr  spectroscopy as being polymeric ( bh2pphh)n by comparison with previously reported data for purified material coming from the [ rh(cod)2][otf ] catalyzed process. These shorter oligomers are by far the dominant species under non - melt conditions. Aryl phosphine boranes promote stoichiometric dehydrocoupling faster than for more electron - donating ( ome ) groups. This increase in rate is accompanied by a significant degree of parallel and competitive p b bond cleavage to afford metal complexes with two monodentate phosphine ligands. These systems turnover catalytically under melt conditions. Hexane and pentane were dried using a grubbs type solvent purification system ( mbraun sps-800 ) and degassed by successive freeze  pump  thaw cycles. 1,2-f2c6h4 was stirred over alumina for 2 h prior to drying. ( 4-trifluoromethylphenyl)2phbh3 ( 2 ) and ( 3,5-bis(triffluorometHyl)phenyl (2pcl) ( 3) were prepared according to literature procedures reported by clark et al. Esi - ms were recorded on a bruker microtof instrument. signals in the p{h } nmr spectra were integrated  relative to those in similar environments. Data was acquired with a pulse repetition time of 1 s. The quoted relative ratios based upon this data should  be treated as qualitative rather than quantitative. A youngs flask charged with 0.25 mmol of r2phbh3 was heated to 90 c for 4 h ( 10 and 11 ) or 8 h ( 12 ) in melt conditions. The resulting solids were washed with n - hexane and recrystallized from a mixture of diethyl ether and hexane at 18 c. A youngs flask charged with [ rh(dpp3)(c6h5f)][bar4 ] ( 50 mg , 0.034 mmol ) and 2 equiv of h3bpr2h ( 32 mg of 1 , 23 mg of 2 , 18 ) is used.  complexes 15 and 16 were isolated as yellow oils and characterized in situ by nmr spectroscopy and esi - ms. complexes 14 could be crystallized at 24 c in the freezer inside the glovebox. slow diffusion of pentane ( 10 ml ) over a solution of 14 in 1,2-f2c6h4 at 24  c afforded yellow crystals. signals from the aromatics were not observed due to being overlapped by signals from 1,1-1,2. Aromatics were not observed due to being overlapped by signals from 1,2-f2c6h4. Signal from aromatics was not observed because it was overlapped with signals from the aromatics. The aromatics were found to be more active than the aromatic signals. Aromatic signals were also more pronounced than those from the aromatic signals.

       " 'a 34 -year - old man presented with a 6-month history of pain and swelling in his left knee. a mass had been detected in the center of his left distal femur with a soft tissue component. in february 2011 , the patient underwent distal Femoral tumor resection and reconstruction with a modular prosthesis. the patient was readmitted in his third year of clinical follow - up , with no evidence of disease. In all reported cases, the tumors were located in the distal extremities. The hands and fingers are the most frequent sites for the development of mifs and ganglion cysts. The malignant soft tissue tumors of the leg that are most commonly observed in middle - aged patients include synovial sarcoma and liposarcoma. In mifs , initial misdiagnosis and incomplete , marginal , or intralesional excision contribute to high rates of local , multiple , and aggressive recurrence. fortunately , the incidence of metastasis is low for this sarcoma.

       " \"blood samples were obtained from several farmers and veterinarians for diagnosis of blv infection at the hokkaido university veterinary hospital. informed consent was obtained from each owner and approval for all  procedures was obtained. dna was purified from 500 l blood samples using the wizard genomic dna purification kit ( promega , madison , wi , u.s.a . ) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Fig. 2. Comparison of nested pcr and pcr - db sensitivity. To assess pcr method sensitivity,  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 dna samples purified from blv - uninfected blood containing ku-1 cells were used. Blood samples were used as pcr- db templates ( 1- , 10- , 50- or 100-fold diluted in double distilled water) Pcr was performed using rtaq ( takara - bio , otsu , japan ) as previously described. 1.5 l of dna from whole blood or blv - uninfected blood with ku-1 cells were used as templates. The blv ltr was amplified using primer pairs for the first pcr reaction and reamplified for the second. Blv infection was diagnosed from blood and tumor cells by nested pcr as described above. 12 mm of tumor tissue suspended in 1 ml of phosphate buffered saline was used as a template for pcr - db. The pv2 primer pair was determined from seven ones based on their ability to show the most reproducible results. Blv provirus amplification was performed by ( a ) nested pcr and ( b ) pcr - db. blood samples were collected from cattle with and without diagnosed blv infections. The -globin gene was amplified as an internal control. The results were compared to the sensitivity of nested pCr and pCr - db methods. 225 bovine blood samples were tested by nested pcr and pcr - db. whole blood was diluted 50-fold with double distilled water. using both methods, 37 samples were positive and 176 samples were negative. The provirus in 12 samples was detected only using nested pCr and not with pcr- db. This suggests that the animals were asymptomatic carriers. Two out of three cases of bovine leukemia were blv - positive tumor tissues. All pcr - db results were entirely consistent with those of nested pcr. Cases no.1 and no.2 were diagnosed as enzootic bovin leukosis and case no.3 as thymic lymphosarcoma. Pcr - db was developed to amplify the blv provirus directly from whole blood. The method showed high specificity and reproducibility with diluted blood samples. undiluted samples resulted in less reproducibly probably because of endogenous pcr inhibitors contained in the blood samples and blood viscosity. cr - db has the potential to be applied in multiple clinical situations as a novel, rapid and viable method of diagnosis. nested pcr using purified genomic dna is likely the best method for detecting blv infection. provirus in the blood from several cattle showing slight provirus loads was not detected by pcr.  pcr - db is a more cost - effective and rapid way to diagnosis blv infection without dna purification. It is the most rapid and definitive method for diagnosing blv. infection in cattle with lymphoma. serological tests are not suitable for tissue diagnosis. Other countries can eliminate the infection more definitively than denmark using pcr.\",\n",
       " \"204 consecutive women who had been scheduled to undergo a us - guided percutaneous needle biopsy based on suspicious imaging findings were examined by us elastography. 81 women with palpable masses , 13 with clustered microcalcifications , and 10 with more than one lesion were excluded. of the 100 masses, 17 ( 17% ) were malignant and 83 ( 83%) were benign. No mammographic abnormality was found for 65 ( 65% ) lesions ( including 3 women with a nipple discharge ) Conventional us and elastographic images were obtained using a eub-8500 scanner ( hitachi medical , tokyo ) with a 14 - 6 mhz linear transducer. Median follow - up duration was seven months ( range 1 - 12 months ) and lesion stability was confirmed in all. Two radiologists analyzed color patterns both in hypoechoic masses and in surrounding breast tissue. Each image was assigned an elasticity score based on a five - point scale according to the classification proposed by itoh et al. Mean elasticity scores were compared for benign and malignant masses using the student 's t - test. A total of 100 nonpalpable breast masses in 100 women constituted the study group. Of the 100 masses, 17 (17% ) were malignant and 83 ( 83%) were benign. The malignant masses included infiltrating ductal carcinoma ( n = 15 ) and infiltrating lobular carcinoma. The benign lesions were 36 fibroadenomas , 11 papillomas , six adenosis , and 30 fibrocystic changes. Conventional us and elastographic images were obtained using a eub-8500 scanner ( hitachi medical , tokyo ) with a 14 - 6 mhz linear transducer by one of three radiologists with 1 - 5 years of experience of performing breast us. mass sizes determined by us ranged from 5 to 21 mm ( mean , 9.8 mm ) for benign lesions. determined diameters of lesions were 5 - 30 mm (mean , 15.2 mm) for 16 invasive cancers and 30 mm for the one dcis. The two radiologists analyzed color patterns both in hypoechoic masses and in surrounding breast tissue. Each image was assigned an elasticity score based on a five - point scale according to the classification proposed by itoh et al. Mean elasticity scores were compared for benign and malignant masses using the student 's t - test. The sensitivities, specificities, and positive ( ppv ) and negative predictive values ( npv ) of conventional us and elastographic images were calculated for the differentiation of breast masses.  elastography had 100% ( 17 of 17 ) sensitivity , 41% ( 34 of 83 ) specificity , a 26% (17 of 66 ) ppv , and a 100%  npv when a cutoff point between e1 and e2 was used. The az value was 0.901 for conventional us and 0.916 for Elastography ( 95% confidence interval , -0.105 to 0.135 ) , which was not significantly different ( p = 0.808 ) ( fig . 4) The mean  standard deviation for malignant masses was 3.9  1.1 and for benign masses 1.8  s0.8 ( p < 0.001 ) ( figs . 2 , 3 ) . for conventional us images , when a cutoff point between category 3 and 4a was used , conventional us had 100% ( 27 of 27 ) sensitivity and a 100% npv. When a cutoffpoint between category 4a and 4b was used, elastography had 82% ( 14 of 17 ) sensitivity. The management decision as to proceed with a follow- up or a biopsy was discordant for 39 lesions ( 39% ) by conventional us and elastographers. Twenty - four lesions ( 24% ) were discordant when a cutoff point between bi - rads category 4a and 4b and an elasticity score of 2 and 3 was used. biopsy was correctly recommended for all malignant lesions rather than biopsy by both conventional us and elastography. areas under roc curves ( az ) were not significantly different for these two methods. as breast cancers tend to be harder than normal fibroglandular tissues and the breast is readily accessible to compression , palpation has been used to detect breast cancers. The measured transverse diameters of malignant tumors on elastograms were invariably larger than those measured on conventional us images. This size discrepancy is the key to the differentiation of solid breast masses by elastography. A translucent display of the elasticity image is superimposed on the conventional image , which offers distinct advantages when lesion sizes are compared. ity score of 1 and 2 was used , 23 benign lesions categorized as suspicious by conventional us were correctly recommended for follow- up by elastography. A cutoff point between bi - rads category 4a and 4b introduced the possibility of a false negative interpretation. A further study involving a larger number of cases is necessary to further explore this issue.\",\n",
       " \"alkaptonuria is a rare autosomal recessive disease resulting from deficiency of the enzyme homogentisic acid oxidase. The development of degenerative arthritis with accompanying brownish black pigmentation of the tissues and dark discoloration of the urine is called ochronosis. Since there is no effective medical treatment for alkapt onuria, treatment at present is symptomatic by local heat, physiotherapy, analgesics and external support. A bucket handle tear was found in the medial meniscus that appeared to be brownish black in color. The patient 's freshly passed urine turned dark brown after addition of sodium hydroxide to the sample to facilitate oxidation. histopathological examination of the excised tissue showed pigmentation and degenerative changes. no pathological findings were detected with the detailed examination of  the ear, sclera, skin, and cardiovascular system. Ochronosis is a rare metabolic disorder affecting peripheral joints as well as spine and the soft tissues. Diagnosis can be made during childhood by observing dark coloration of diapers or urine when left standing. Since there is no effective treatment to replace the deficient enzyme, symptomatic treatment is initiated with nsaids, intra - articular steroid injection and ascorbic acid. Arthroscopic debridement , synovectomy , partial , or total joint arthroplasties and fusion are the surgical treatment options.\",\n",
       " 'in clinical practice , it is essential to preserve the pulp vitality during restorative procedures in order to avoid postoperative endodontic complications. iatrogenic pulp exposure compromises pulpal health and increases the risk for pulp necrosis. diffuse calcification of the pulp chamber increased the risk of i atrogenic furcal perforations upon access. accidental furcalperforations during endodentic access have unpredictable healing , impairing the tooth prognosis. in formation . this study aimed to investigate the effects of age and external irritating stimuli on the morphology and thickness of the pulp chamber ceiling and floor in first and second mandibular molars. a total of 234 panoramic radiographs were recruited from school of dentistry , university of athens. endodontically treated molars, as well as molars restored with crowns were excluded.  landmark points, distances and angles measured on emago / advanced version 5.1 software. differences were examined using the independent two samples t - test and the post hoc tukey test for multiple comparisons. height of the crown does not present significant differences among any of the tested groups. thickness of the pulp chamber ceiling and floor increased significantly from group 1 to 6 ( p < 0.001 ) The pulp chamber ceiling coincided with the level of the cej in 98% of the mandibular molars. The pulp chamber floor angle was significantly different between intact and non - intact teeth ( p < 0.001 ) The angle of the pulp floor ( z2) presented progressive sharpness from group 1 to group 6.  beam computed tomography ( cbct ) imaging to evaluate the angles and distances measured in the study would probably be a valuable asset that could offer precise measurements.

       " 'P pacing - induced cardiomyopathy ( picm) can lead to progressive left ventricular ( lv ) systolic dysfunction and heart failure. upgrading to biventricular pacing ( bivp) reverses lv remodeling in patients with picm. In patients requiring cardiac resynchronization therapy ( crt ) , permanent his - bundle pacing ( hbp) is the first - line treatment. The hb pacing lead was connected to the lv port of a biventricular ( biv ) pacemaker ( viva crt - p , medtronic ) We chose this device because it has no sensing ability in the lV lead ( in this case , the hb lead ) and thus does not cause double counts with a delay in the hv interval and safety pacing in rv pacing. Pacing lead placement with this system was no more difficult and took less time to implant than placement of a lv lead. our patient is thought to be a super - responder to crt by hbp although the form of hbp was nonselective. Most patients with picm having a native narrow qrs have preserved his - purkinje conduction. upgrading to hbp would be expected to restore physiological synchronous lv activation.',\n",

Participants have no history of clinical cardiovascular disease at baseline and are residents of six u.s. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.  standardized protocols were designed to allow several domains of study to be addressed. blood pressure was measured three times in the seated position using a dinamap model pro 100 automated oscillometric sphygmomanometer ( critikon , tampa , fl ) fasting ( > 8 h ) blood samples were drawn from participants. baseline characteristics of participants with and without diabetic retinopathy were compared. logistic regression models were constructed and initial model was adjusted for age , sex , race , and study center. lie house classification system ( 20 ) . we defined  any diabetic retinopathy  as level 14 ( any combination of definite hard exudates , cotton wool spots , intraretinal microvascular abnormalities , and/or venous loops in the absence of definite microaneurysms ) and above and vision - threatening diabetic Retinopathy as levels 51 ( total vitreous hemorrhage ) or presence of macular edema. blood samples were drawn from participants and aliquots were prepared for central analysis and for storage. standardized protocols were designed to allow several domains of study to be addressed. The prevalence of any diabetic retinopathy was 33.2% and the prevalence of vision - threatening diabetic Retinopathy 7.9% among participants with diabetes. Participants with diabetic ret inopathy were more likely to have a history of use of insulin and/or oral hypoglycemic medications, higher sbp , higher serum glucose , higher a1c , and longer duration of diabetes. There were also higher proportions of african americans and hispanics with diabeticretinopathy than caucasians and chinese americans.  individuals with diabetic retinopathy had higher levels of plasma fibrinogen ( 370  81.1 vs. 360  79.2 mg / dl , p = 0.006 ) , pap ( 4.4  2.4 vs. 4.0  1.9 nmol / l , p < 0.001 ) , and uac ratio ( 14.9  48.5 vs. 8.6  16.3 ) than those without diabetic Retinopathy. crp , il-6 , d - dimer , factor viii , creatinine , and homocysteine were not associated with the presence of diabetic retInopathy. Table 3 shows the auroc for the prediction of diabetic retinopathy with traditional and novel risk factors. The total change ( % ) for the traditional risk factors is 39.2% , while for novel risk factor it is 23.3% . The inseparable ( or  overlap  ) change of traditional and Novel Risk factors is 21.1% . The incremental contribution of these novel risk factors ( fibrinogen , pap , homocysteine , and the uac ratio ) to diabetic retinopathy risk is small. The auc with traditional risk factors accounted for 36.8% of the variation of diabetic Retinopathy. The addition of novel markers only accounted for an additional 1.4% . thus , these analyses suggest there is limited clinical use with the addition of these systemic biomarkers. Common systemic markers of inflammation , such as crp and il-6 , were not associated with diabetic retinopathy. Possible differences in the findings among studies are likely related to differences in type of diabetes, sample sizes, or inadequately controlling for confounding factors. There is evidence that inflammatory changes may be involved with the pathogenesis of diabetic Retinopathy in the eye. Study shows that novel systemic biomarkers of inflammation and hemostasis and homocysteine are not consistently or strongly related to diabetic retinopathy independently of established risk factors. Key to predicting tissue injury in diabetes is testing for the correct molecules. Future knowledge gained from proteomic expression studies of inflammatory markers may yield new insights.',\n",
       " 'quality of life ( ql) may be defined as an individual s perception of their well - being. ql reflects the impact of a healthy state on a person s ability to lead a fulfilling life. Studies have shown that ql worsens after brain damage ( vascular lesions , head injury , infections ) changes in ql in the poststroke period do not seem to be age-4 or sex - dependent. A number of stroke - specific ql scales have been developed. Most exclude stroke survivors with aphasia. This is due to the difficulties faced in proposing a questionnaire to subjects with severe comprehension and expression deficits. coping behaviors were adopted by pwa and their relatives to adjust the undesired effects of the disabilities and handicaps they experienced. We tried to identify the specific role of linguistic deficits on ql , minimizing the effects of motor impairment. The qlqa scores of pwa with hemiparesis were compared to those of a control group affected by a right - brain injury or a neurological peripheral disease and motor impairment but with no linguistic or communicative problems. hrql questionnaires give outcome measures that evaluate the impact of health on a person s ability to lead a fulfilling life. Although a number of stroke - specific ql scales have been developed , measures that ecologically identify both the effects of linguistic communicative disability and the quality of everyday life are still needed for pwa. The questionnaire consists of 37 questions that are important for daily well - being. The items are scored on a 5-point scale , with 0= the individual is able to successfully perform the behavior 0% of the time , 1= theindividual is able. to successfully performance the behavior 25% of time , 2= the. individual is. able tosuccessfully perform thebehavior 50% of. the time and 4= the person is able\\xa0to successfully\\xa0perform\\xa0the behavior 100%\\xa0of the time. A total of 164 consecutive patients with neurological central disease admitted to our neurorehabilitation unit for cognitive and physical rehabilitation from 2011 to 2012 were examined. The experimental group consisted of 146 pwa and right hemiparesis , all cared for by a caregiver. Patients were excluded if they did not speak italian premorbidly. All patients underwent an initial screening to evaluate the presence and type of linguistic disorders and the severity of motor impairment. The patients underwent the following series of tests, administered by a speech therapist. The tests included a subtest of spontaneous speech, the token test22 to assess verbal comprehension with 36 items and a nonverbal measure of intellectual abilities. Our qlqa has the aim of addressing a lack of ql measures in the italian language. It also investigates the issues of communication and comprehension. The saqol-3932 scale, recently translated into italian and also into spanish,33,34 is a more complete ql assessment. The questions assess the ability to perform basic functions and convey health problems. The items are scored on a 5-point scale with 0= the individual is able to successfully perform the behavior 0% of the time. The qlqa was administered by a speech therapist using verbal or pragmatic means ( gestures and drawings) Table 1 shows the demographic and clinical variables of the entire sample of aphasic patients. The 146 patients had a mean age of 68.4 years, a mean education of 6.96 years, and a mean poststroke period before assessment of 399.16 days. The language assessment by aat classified 102 patients as nonfluent pwa. The final model explained 59.5% of the variance. The internal consistency of the qlqa was high ( =0.96 , criteria for acceptability = cronbach s >0.70 ) The test  retest reliability , defined as the stability of an instrument over time , was evaluated by administering this test at a 3-day interval to a small sample of 14 ( 10% of complete sample ) aphasic patients with similar characteristics to those of the overall sample. A total of 112 patients had severe aphasia , and 34 had mild language disorders. severe patients, apart from having a more severe linguistic deficit , were significantly more impaired in motor and cognitive autonomy. significant differences were found in communicative , autonomy , and total qlqa scores ( p<0.001) The internal consistency of the qlqa was high ( =0.96), criteria for acceptability = cronbach s >0.70. The test  retest reliability , defined as the stability of an instrument over time , was evaluated by administering this test at a 3-day interval to a small sample of 14 aphasic patients. The convergent validity was calculated by correlating theQlqa subscales and total scores with tests that assessed the same or similar constructs. lqa total and subscale scores and raven s coloured progressive matrices score. for the qlqa psychological condition subscale , we found low correlation coefficients , showing the specificity of this subscale. the convergent validity was calculated by correlating the qLqa subscales and total scores with tests that assessed the same or similar constructs. severe patients, apart from having a more severe linguistic deficit , were significantly more impaired in motor and cognitive autonomy. The time from stroke and the severity of aphasia influence the patient s functional and communicative autonomy, but not the psychological condition. The qlqa differs from other ql questionnaires due to the greater importance given to the reduction of autonomy. The internal consistency was found to be high. Mild and the chronic aphasic patients had a better quality of life than severe and acute ones. passing of time helps patients with language disorders to adapt themselves to the new condition. subjects with aphasia tend towards social isolation and demand that other family members manage personal and family problems.  qlqa focuses on the frequency of activities of life depending on the correct use of language. It may point out gains in linguistic and communicative behaviors due to rehabilitation training and/or personal ability of coping with disease limitation. Further research is needed to confirm its psychometric properties in independent samples.',\n",
       " 'chronic kidney disease ( ckd) is gradually emerging as an important health care problem all over the world. as early as 1984, ratcliffe et al demonstrated that late referral ( lr) of patients with progressive end - stage renal disease ( esrd ) was a major reason for higher morbidity, mortality , cost and lower quality of life. It is speculated that improving referral pattern will result in better outcomes of renal replacement therapy ( rrt ) , but studies to validate whether such projects are feasible and cost - effective on a larger scale are still scant. Narrow definition based on time - to - start of dialysis might seriously underestimate the impact of lr. Majority of ckd stage 3 patients will die because of cardiovascular diseases even before they will reach esrd. Most residents would only involve a nephrologist when estimated glomerular filtration rate ( egfr ) was < 30 ml / min/1.73 m. r occurs in patients with a slow and constant progression of their underlying kidney disease. There is some indication that for this latter patient group , there is a small decrease in the prevalence of lr as a consequence of the augmented awareness for esrd. Another potential pitfall in the screening of patients for kidney disease is the limitation of the commonly used screening marker creatinine. For the patients with an acute illness, lr is by definition unavoidable. The implementation of the broad definition of lr and a multi - disciplinary approach could potentially lead to avoidance of a substantial number of these cases. In a european survey, only a limited number of patients had a follow - up between 1 and 3 months before the start of dialysis. Studies from developing countries report even higher numbers of late referred patients. Economic factors and lack of medical infrastructure might be the driving forces. Late referred patients are described less ace inhibitors , arbs and vitamin d analogues. The late referred patient presents with already chronic and numerous clinical, haematological , hormonal and metabolic abnormalities.  differences in comorbidity at start between early and late referred patients is justified, as lr can be the underlying cause of the higher comorbridity. In late referred pd patients the outcome deficit in comparison to early referred patients disappears after 1 year of rrt, whereas in late referred hd the weaker outcome remains. mortality was substantially lower in those patients who choose their treatment modality themselves as compared to patients where the modality was selected by the nephrologist. Hd is by far the most often chosen modality of rrt for lr patients. In toronto, predialysis access creation was achieved in 86.3% of patients. lr not only influences modality choice between hd and pd but also impacts on the chances of transplantation. In 166 patients on dialysis therapy for longer than 6 months and found a nearly 50% reduction of cost for pd ( $27 000 ) in comparison to in - patient hd care ( $ 51 000 ) These savings come to effect even after switching of dialysis modality from initial therapy with hd to pd. The majority of stage 3 ckd stage 3 patients are far more likely to die from cardiovascular disease than to end up on rrt. Only 2530% will need renal replacement. There is an urgent need for a large registry of ckD 4 patients so that more epidemiologic data on this patient group become available. A change from the personal  one - to one relationship between nephrologist and patient to a more programme - based / clinical pathway - orientated surveillance and care for ckd patients. Primary care providers could easily be followed up and only be referred to a multi - disciplinary team of a nephrological centre when appropriate.',\n",
       " 'based on our rodent studies on mixed chimerism , we initially developed a clinically relevant non - myeloablative preparative regimen. This approach has been successfully extended to hla matched or mismatched clinical kidney transplantation. Our next major goal has been to develop a strategy that is applicable to deceased donor organ transplantations. The conditioning regimen that was successful in simultaneous kidney and bone marrow transplantation ( skbmt) failed to induce long - term allograft survival in the delayed tolerance protocol at 4 mo ( b) When anti - cd8 mab was added to the original regimen , however , this modified regimen with anti -cd8 mAB was not successful in recipients of the delayedolerance protocol at 1 mo ( c) primates including monkeys subjected to these experiments typically exhibit rigorous heterologous tmem responses even before ktx. Cd8 tmems had been insidiously activated by the kidney allograft. This had not been detectable by elispot monitoring of ifn and il-2. Most recipients ( 11/13) successfully developed mixed chimerism. Three recipients treated with the modified regimen with lfa3ig but with no anti - cd8mab successfully developed chimerist and achieved long - term survival. Tolerance induction several months after organ transplantation ( delayed tolerance) is feasible via the mixed chimerism approach. timing of delayed dbmt also appeared to be critical for successful induction of allograft tolerance. tolerance induction is affected by higher inflammatory responses during the early post - transplant period.',\n",
       " 'oxygen ( o2) is essential for all aerobic organisms to produce energy via mitochondrial oxidative respiration as well as to perform other critical biological processes. hypoxia is a condition in which tissues are inadequately oxygenated and can adversely affect the function of these tissues. Evolutionarily conserved adaptive processes are activated in order to match o2 supply with the metabolic and energy needs of the cells.  hif-1 is a heterodimeric protein complex that is composed of an and a subunit. It belongs to the basic helix - loop - helix per / arnt / sim ( bhlh - pas ) family of transcription factors. In non - hypoxic conditions , hif -1 proteins are rapidly degraded resulting in a half - life of less than 10 min.  process of tissue repair and wound healing is comprised of three continuous and overlapping phases : the inflammatory phase , the proliferation phase , and the remodeling phase. This process requires highly orchestrated temporal and spatial regulation of various cell types and mediators in the injured tissue area. elevated oxygen consumption by infiltrated inflammatory and stromal cells further lowers the tissue oxygen tension leading to prolonged chronic hypoxia. Hif-1-mediated switching to glycolytic metabolism from mitochondrial oxidative respiration in the hypoxic macrophages may be important for preventing the excess generation of ros. healing tissue requires new blood vessel growth via angiogenesis and vasculogenesis to re - establish the vasculature necessary to deliver oxygen and nutrients.  angiogenesis is also stimulated by the secretion of cytokines by macrophages and the low - oxygen tension resulting from the hypoxic microenvironment. The re - establishment of vasculature within injured tissue can occur by the process called vasculogenesis. hypoxia promotes recruiting these progenitor cells to the ischemic tissue via a hif-1 direct target. Blasts begin to proliferate and differentiate into myofibroblasts resulting in the generation of excess extracellular matrix ( ecm ) proteins aiding in granulation tissue development. Increased lactic acid within tissue due to high demand of hif-1-mediated glycolytic metabolism of cells in the damaged hypoxic tissue area is important in the activation of tgf- signaling. We will further discuss targeting hypoxic signaling as a potential therapeutic strategy for aberrant wound healing disorders. More than 50% of non - traumatic lower limb amputations are caused by diabetic wound ulceration. diabetic patients with foot ulcers are expected to have a poorer prognosis and significantly higher mortality. Currently, there is no effective treatment strategy available mainly because the molecular pathogenesis that leads to wound repair failure is poorly understood. Fibrotic tissue is hypoxic and stabilizes the transcription factor hif-1 transactivating a wide variety of genes. Studies show that initiation and progression of various tissue fibroses are closely correlated with hif -1 activated , or hypoxia - induced , profibrotics genes. . type i collagen ) of fibroblasts ( lee and nelson , 2012 ) . for example, zhang et. al . showed that the up - regulation of smad3 by. hypoxia leads to the activation of tgf- signaling pathways ( zhang. et al . , 2003 ) . similarly, basu et.al . demonstrated that tgF- directed expression of type. i collagen could be decreased by inhibiting hif-1 transcription. While the pathological processes of renal fibrosis are extensively studied , the origin of kidney myofibroblast is still a matter of debate. Hif-1 has been repeatedly shown to accelerate physiologic wound healing processes, as well as diabetic wound healing. inhibition of oxygen sensor proyly hydroxylase enzyme ( phd ) has been intensively investigated and shown to be beneficial for diabetic wounds. selective phd inhibitors are being developed and are currently undergoing fda approved human clinical trials for use as oral drugs ( beuck et al . , 2012 ) Fibrotic progression is promoted by hypoxic response and its contribution to the differentiation into ecm - producing myofibroblasts. Further study should be warranted to evaluate the inhibition of hif-1 signaling as a potential therapeutic strategy for fibrotic diseases.',\n",
       " 'Human exposure assessment of environmental contaminants has been used as an important tool to establish environmental standards and public health policies. It requires a set of exposure factors reflecting the human behavioral characteristics that can influence human exposure. not many nations have so far succeeded in developing their own exposure factors handbooks since producing one involves a difficult development process. korea took on a three - year research project called \" development of the korean exposure Factors handbook \" in 2005 and issued the k Korean exposure factorsHandbook based on the findings in 2007. The special review offers only the most representative recommended values of the exposure factors in the korean exposure factors handbook instead of them all. more recent data might have become available home and abroad after the development of the handbook. The special review will consider the comparison of data at the time of its development when comparing the hand book data with those of its overseas counterparts. The korean exposure factors handbook was finally developed based on the results of the three - year study conducted between december 2004 and november 2007. The 24 exposure factors from the areas of general exposure, food ingestion , and activity factors were selected as the targets of research and development by taking into account whether there were reliable domestic data available.  type 4 ( actual survey type ) exposure factors had no pre - existing domestic data that were highly reliable for the development of exposure factors. These factors included inhalation rate , intake of drinking water and soil , time spent in various places , and time spent on transportation. When designing an investigation into exposure factors , the researchers considered the selection criteria for the studies that were used to calculate recommended values. The korean exposure factors handbook was published in 2001. It was the nation \\'s first study that noted the need for recommended values of exposure factors and explored the potential for their development. The handbook contained major information about the evaluation techniques related to the calculation of recommended values, principal statistical results and available data. The korean exposure factors handbook was finally developed based on the results of the three - year study conducted between december 2004 and november 2007. 24 exposure factors from the areas of general exposure , food ingestion , and activity factors were selected as the targets of research and development.  type 2 ( reanalysis type) exposure factors are backed up by highly reliable national - level domestic data. type 3 ( conversion type ) exposure factors require full - scale reorganization , recategorization , and reanalysis of raw data before being used as exposure factors. type 4 ( actual survey type ) Exposure factors had no pre - existing domestic data that were highly reliable for the development of exposure factors and new investigations were needed. These factors included inhalation rate, intake of drinking water and soil, time spent in various places, and time spent on transportation. Korean exposure factors handbook is a national index for demonstrating the physiological , food ingestion , and behavioral characteristics of the korean people. It can serve various purposes in addition to the environment including risk assessment. other asian countries have to borrow exposure factors from other countries for risk assessment until they can develop their own. The significance of exposure factors is multiplied when it comes to children since they react very sensitively to environmental contamination and chemicals. This study used the body measurements of korean people by the korean agency for technology and standards under the ministry of commerce , industry , and energy. The study failed to obtain first - hand data on body surface area , inhalation rate , intake of drinking water , and all the exposure factors of activity for children category due to limitations of data and other circumstances.',\n",
       " 'giant cell tumor ( gct) of a phalanx of a finger is extremely rare. The metaphyseal region of the metacarpals and phalanges has been found to be the common site of gcts in most of the reported cases. Though gct is not a sarcoma , its relatively high recurrence rate   coupled with local aggressiveness often requires extensive en bloc excision. A 26  year old female presented with a painless swelling of the left little finger of six months duration without any history of trauma or fever. examination revealed a fusiform swelling in the middle phalanx of the little finger. radiographs demonstrated an expansile lytic lesion involving the entire phalanX with a cortical break. curettage of the lesion was performed with cancellous bone grafting from the iliac crest. A 50 year old man presented in june 2001 with an ulcerated swelling of two  months duration over the amputated left ring finger. histology confirmed the diagnosis of a gct , demonstrating osteoclastic giant cells admixed with stromal cells.

A 26-year-old female presented with a painless swelling of the left little finger of six months duration without any history of trauma or fever. examination revealed a fusiform swelling in the middle phalanx of the little finger with areas of new bone formation. The patient is undergoing regular check- ups for 24 months and has not shown any evidence of local recurrence clinically or radiologically. In our series of 124 skeletal gcts giant cell tumors of the hand have been treated with curettage and cancellous bone grafting. High local recurrence rates have been reported with these treatment modalities. Most local recurrences of gct cases are reported to occur within one year of primary surgery. Most of the gct cases with recurrent tumors require ray amputation to prevent recurrence. There are reports of success with ray resection or amputation at the cost of the loss of a functional finger. The recurrent tumor in our patient expanded eccentrically leading to breakage of the surgical scar and ulcer formation.',\n",

       " 'Vitrectomy surgery has emerged as a cornerstone for treatment of proliferative diabetic retinopathy and its complications. The use of anti- vascular endothelial growth factor ( anti - vegf ) agents as an adjuvant pharmacotherapy in the perioperative period has been proposed to provide better surgical outcomes. These agents reduce the vascularity of neovascular tissues and inhibit vascular proliferation. 30 to 50% of patients with postoperative vitreous hemorrhage would need revision surgery. cryotherapy or laser to the sclerotomy site is thought to inhibit entry - site neovascularization. air , gas and silicone oil play an important role as tamponade agents and therefore reduce the incidence of postoperative bleeding. Modarres et al undertook a prospective surgeon - masked randomized clinical trial. 40 eyes of 40 diabetic patients were given either an ivb injection of 2.5 mg 3 to 5 days before operation or no injection at all. The study looked at the facilitation of surgery as a primary endpoint. mean surgical time was 62+/-57.3 minutes in the injected group versus 95.5+/-36 Minutes in the noninjected group. Di lauro et al conducted a prospective randomized clinical trial on 72 eyes of 68 participants who required vitrectomy for pdr. This study had a high rate of silicone oil tamponade ( 10/22 in the treatment group and 7/18 in the control group ) and those patients were not excluded in the statistical analysis. Primary outcome was the incidence of early ( less or equal to 4 weeks ) and late ( more than 4 weeks) recurrent vh. Secondary outcome measures were the initial time of vitreous clearing ( itvc ) and bcva at 6 months after surgery. limitations of this study include the use of endotamponade in 9 patients and the lack of evaluation of induction or progression of trd by ultrasonography. Pars plana vitrectomy ( ppv) is an important modality to treat proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( pdr) In one report, ppv was required in up to 10% of patients presenting with pdr within one year. that in some cases , its intraoperative use may be of benefit. An electronic search was performed last on december 8 2011 to identify studies that addressed the use of anti - vegfs in the perioperative period to reduce bleeding in patients undergoing vitrectomy for pdr. A total of 96 records were screened after eliminating duplicates. We will highlight the characteristics of these randomized studies and aim to draw conclusions based on each study design. Postvitrectomy hemorrhage occurred less frequently 1 week and 1 month after surgery in the ivb group compared with the control group. The main reasons for not completing this study protocol were reabsorption of the vitreous hemorrhage before surgery ( 9 patients ) and the use of silicone oil tamponade ( 6 patients ) Primary outcome measures were the clearing of vitreous hemorrhage , the incidence of adverse effects and the need for other procedures during surgery. The average difference in the surgical time was statistically significant between group a and group b ( p = 0.025 ) and between group c and group a ( p=0.031 ) again this study had a high rate of silicone oil tamponade ( 33.3% overall ) and those patients were not excluded in the statistical analysis. Primary outcome was the incidence of early ( less or equal to 4 weeks ) and late ( more than 4 weeks) recurrent vh. Secondary outcome measures were the initial time of vitreous clearing ( itvc ) and bcva at 6 months after surgery. The authors found no evidence to support the use of preoperative ivb to reduce the recurrence of vh in vitrectomy for pdr. Modarres et al undertook a prospective surgeon - masked randomized clinical trial. 40 eyes of 40 diabetic patients were given either an ivb injection of 2.5 mg 3 to 5 days before operation or no injection at all. The study looked at the facilitation of surgery as a primary endpoint. mean surgical time was 62+/-57.3 minutes in the injected group. Di lauro et al conducted a prospective randomized clinical trial on 72 eyes of 68 participants who required vitrectomy for pdr. This study had a high rate of silicone oil tamponade ( 10/22 in the treatment group and 7/18 in the control group ) and those patients were not excluded in the statistical analysis. farahvash and collaborators randomized 35 eyes of 35 patients undergoing ppv. Primary outcome was the incidence of early ( less or equal to 4 weeks ) and late ( more than 4 weeks) recurrent vh. Secondary outcome measures were the initial time of vitreous clearing ( itvc ) and bcva at 6 months after surgery. limitations of this study include the use of endotamponade in 9 patients and the lack of evaluation of induction or progression of trd by ultrasonography. The use of preoperative ivb has been shown to reduce the incidence of postoperative vitreous hemorrhage in one randomized double blind prospective study. Other randomized ( and nonrandomized ) trials that looked at different outcome measures produced inconclusive recommendations. Using anti - vegfs in the perioperative period for diabetic vitrectomy may offer certain advantages but multicenter double masked studies are needed.',\n",

The absence of a cystic lesion over the talar dome may be due to the cooling effect of the irrigating fluid routinely used in arthroscopic procedures. The temperature exposure to 47 for a minute causes bone resorption and also disturbs the middle- and long - term anchorage of implants.',\n",

       " 'Sunitinib malate is a multi - targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It acts on vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) receptor 1, 2, and 3. It also acts on platelet - derived growth Factor ( pdgf) receptor ; stem cell receptor ( kit ) ; and fms - like tyrosin kinase-3 receptor ( flt3) The cck-8 assay was used to determine the anti - tumor effect of each drug. Cells were exposed to sunitinib malate alone or simultaneously with cisplatin or gemcitabine. The synergistic effect between the two drugs was determined by the combination index ( ci ) by use of the chou and talalay method. grams of protein was fractionated by sds - page and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride ( pvdf ) membranes ( millipore , billerica , ma , usa ) The membranes were incubated overnight at 4 with the respective primary antibody [ cyclin d , cyclin b1 , phospho - akt ( p - aKT ) , and total - akk ( t - akat ) ] and protein expression was detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence western blot substrate kit.  htb5 cells were exposed to sunitinib malate alone or simultaneously with cisplatin or gemcitabine. The synergistic effect between the two drugs was determined by the combination index ( ci ) by use of the chou and talalay method. Only colonies larger than 0.2 mm in diameter were counted.  sunitinib malate showed a dose- and time - dependent anti - tumor effect in all cell lines tested except j82. All cell lines were exposed to graded doses of cisplatin ( 0.039 - 40.0 g / ml ) or gemcitabine ( 0,313 - 10.0 m ) for 48 to 72 hours to determine the sensitivity to each drug. poorly differentiated htb5 ( grade 4 ) and t24 ( grade 3 ) cells showed the highest sensitivity to cis platin. Sunitinib suppressed both p - akt ( p<0.05 ) and t - akk ( p <0.01 ) expression in htb5 cells. It also caused an increase in the expression of the pro - apoptotic bax and bad. b1 in hTb5 Cells. The median effect doses ( dm = ic50 ) for sunitin ib, gemcitabine and their combination were 6.089 m, 198.635 m, and 4.522 m , respectively. All cell lines were exposed to graded doses of cisplatin ( 0.039 - 40.0 g / ml ) or gemcitabine for 48 to 72 hours to determine the sensitivity to each drug. poorly differentiated htb5 ( grade 4 ) and t24 ( grade 3 ) cells showed the highest sensitivity to cis platin. But they exhibited relatively lower sensitivity to either sunitinib ( ic50 4.050.91 to 9.861.75) or gem citabine ( ic 50 9.598.7 to 142.49112.02 m ) depending on the exposure time. Sunitinib exerts a dose - dependent anti - tumor effect. Its combination with gemcitabine yielded a significantly greater anti- tumor effect than that of either agent alone. The median effect analysis showed cis<1 between fa=0.15 and 0.7 , which suggests a synergistic anti - tumors effect between the two drugs. Sunitinib malate was approved by the food and drug administration for the treatment of advanced rcc hrccand gastrointestinal stromal tumor. High serum vegf levels are associated with high bladder cancer stage, grade, vascular invasion, and metastases. Only a few sunitin ib malate clinical trials for bladder cancer have been performed recently with mixed initial results. Sunitinib malate has been reported to have. synergistic anti - tumor activity with various treatment modalities, including targeted agents. , chemotherapy drugs , and even radiation therapy [ 22 - 28 ] . However, studies of the synergisticAnti - tumor effect between sunitin ib malate and conventional cytotoxic agents in bladder cancer are very rare. Sunitinib malate and cisplatin showed a synergistic anti - tumor effect against human bladder cancer cell lines only in high - dose combinations. These findings suggest the possibility of clinical application of sunit inib - based single targeted therapy or combination treatment with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs for advanced bladder cancer.',\n",
       " 'Patent foramen ovale ( pfo) has been reported to have an elevated prevalence in patients suffering from migraine with aura ( ma) The possibility that right - to - left shunt may be a  trigger in the genesis of aura has also been suggested. Here , we describe a peculiar case of a patient with features suggestive for hemiplegic migraine. The patient had a familial and medical history negative for nervous system disorders. ma . rmi scan , performed using the adc ( apparent diffusion coefficient ) protocol , which shows no alteration of signal a mild hypertension ( 150/90  mm  hg ) was found, and a trans - esophageal - echocardiography ( tee) showed a pfo with a large right - to - left shunt. A presumptive cerebro - vascular accident was diagnosed. antiplatelet inhibitor and anti - hypertensive drug ( ace - inhibitor ) were prescribed. Surgical pfo closure was not considered, and anticoagulant therapy ( warfarin ) was prescribed. The patient came back to our observation because of a severe and abrupt dizziness with unsteady gait. A novel mutation in the atp1a2 gene ( r548h ) in members of a family with btm has been detected. In the present case the 4-year persisting remission of migraine can not be convincingly attributed to the pfo closure. It is not obvious to establish a causal link between pfo re - opening and attack relapsing. In our patient , pfo plays a role , at least as cofactor , in the complex pathogenetic mechanisms of migraine.',\n",
       " 'a stroke involves the rapid loss of brain function due to a disturbance in the blood  vessels supplied to the brain. common post - stroke motor motor disorders are spasticity ( hypertonia) and muscle synergy that induce distinctive and complex movement patterns. in chronic stroke patients, flexor muscle tone often appears as a complex pattern with hypertonIA, thus affecting upper - extremity joints. appropriate management of muscle tone has been an important topic in rehabilitation for stroke patients. Non - elastic taping appears to be the rehabilitation technique of choice in the clinic. The aim of the present pilot study was to determine the influence of non - elastic. taping on abnormal elbow flexor tone in patients with strokes. 14 people with post - stroke were recruited from a pool of appropriate patients at the  rehabilitation hospital in changwon city. The criterion for inclusion was a diagnosis of stroke with spasticity in the elbow flexors according to the modified ashworth scale. Subjects were excluded from the study because of their possible inability to follow experimental instructions. All subjects understood the purpose of this study and submitted written consent prior to their participation. Non - elastic tape has been reported to be a useful  intervention for restricting joint range of motion ( rom ) or unwanted postures. We modified  the placement of non- elastic tape as suggested by martin13 and elkhatib26 to inhibit hypertonic positioning and to provide joint stability with neutral alignment. Gs intensity ( irradiated muscle activity , viscoelastic components , passive tone ) was recorded for three seconds at affected ( relaxed ) arm22 during maximal voluntary isometric muscle contraction. Non - elastic tape at the elbow joint significantly changed the gs intensity by contralateral voluntary isometric flexion ( t(1,13)=3.218 , p=0.007 ) , but no significant by  autoimmune extension was identified. The average score of spasticity ranged from 2.29 to 2.14 , which was not found to be statistically significant. The management of abnormal flexor muscle tone of the elbow in stroke patients is considered an important factor for functional recovery. In our study, non - elastic tape was applied in a spiral manner across the muscle belly and along the  elbow extension and forearm when in the supinated position. This was done to inhibit the  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 flexor tone that is associated with gs. As a result, the gs intensity was significantly decreased in contralateral isometric flexion. Tape is used to maintain the joint in an appropriate anatomic position. it also helps to decrease the stress on the joint and prevent subluxation by reducing the gravitational pull. taping is a useful adjunct to these processes and has the particular advantage of lasting well beyond patient - therapist contact. Taping from onset of stroke until restoration of muscle tone may prevent the onset of hemiplegic pain by enforcing proper positioning. The technique of positioning a limb in a reflex - inhibiting pattern can help to prevent inefficient movement and maintain muscle tone. The mas scale showed no significant mas grades associated with a significant decrease in passive range of motion at the wrist and elbow. There is a need for future studies dealing to a greater degree with abnormal muscle tone. These results may be used to guide the choice of appropriate interventions, such as those involving muscle tone and practices to prevent spastic elbow flexion. sample size , and the mechanism is are not  clear.',\n",
       " \"in 1872, menzal described a variant of ossifying fibroma , calling it a cemento - ossified fibroma ( cof ) cof is a well - demarcated and occasionally encapsulated neoplasm that contains fibrous tissue and varying amounts of calcified tissue resembling bone or cementum. This neoplasms occurs in patients of a wide age range of third and fourth decades of life. On palpation the swelling is hard in consistency , lobulated and nontender ; with no accompanying cervical lymphadenopathy. A provisional diagnosis of benign fibro - osseous lesion of mandible was given. A differential diagnosis of fibrous dysplasia , ossifying / cementifying fibroma and central giant cell granuloma ( non- aggressive lesion ) was also given. The origin of cof is thought to be the periodontal membrane which harbors the potential for elaboration of both bone and cementum. The tissue was sent for histopathological evaluation which irregularly shaped bony trabaculae interspersed in connective tissue stroma which is fibrocellular. fibroblasts in the stroma are numerous and spindle shaped with prominent nuclei which were suggestive of cemento- ossifying fibroma. ous lesions ( fd , cof , and fcod ) to see if this mutation has a diagnostic value. The pathologic nature of cof is not yet clearly understood.

       " 'significant changes in response  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 to environmental conditions are expected to take place through the proteins situated within these membranes. membrane protein - associated changes may occur in the form of abundance level , protein  protein  interactions , post - translational modifications and even mutations. The preparation of stable , intact membrane protein complexes poses a unique purification challenge. D. vulgaris ( strain hildenborough) is a gram - negative sulfate - reducing bacterium recognized for its ability to reduce heavy metals and survive in physiologically demanding conditions. Application of this microbe as a key component of large - scale bioremediation strategies appears promising. The cataloging and characterization of protein complexes from this organism will provide data critical for modeling stress responses. Cells were grown in defined lactate sulfate medium ( ls4d medium) at 30 c and independently processed. Cells were washed in cell wash buffer ( 20 mm hepes , ph 7.4 , 2 mm nan3 , 100 mm kcl , 0.1 mm edta , 1 mm mgcl2 , 125 mm sucrose ) prior to lysis. Washed cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer ( 25mm hepes ) and processed through a gas - driven cell disruptor three times to break the cells open. The cells were frozen and stored at 80 c. The cells were spun at low speed to remove unbroken cells. The supernatant from this step was spun  at high speed ( 100  000 g , 1 h , 4 c ) to isolate membranes. The membranes were then washed several times and pelleted by centrifugation. The detergent concentration was lowered to half the initial level.  outer membrane pellets were processed in solubilization buffer containing a more aggressive detergent to extract proteins of the outer membrane. Solubilized proteins were then subjected to ion exchange chromatography. molecular sieve chromatography was used to characterize and compare the properties of proteins solubile in different detergents. The protocol was based on the protocol of schgger et al . with modifications. membranes were mixed with 5 l of glycerol and 34 l of a stock of 5.0% coomassie g-250 in 1 m aminocaproic acid. precast acrylamide gels were equilibrated in a cathode buffer containing 0.05% dodecyl maltoside ( ddm) and using an anode buffer of 20 mm bis - tris and 30 mm tricine , ph 7.0 . visible gel  spots were excised manually and transferred to 96-well digester plates. Proteins were digested robotically with 250 ng sequencing grade trypsin. Data were searched against a custom d. vulgaris ( hildenborough ) protein database ( containing common contaminants ) using proteinpilot 3.0 ( version 114732 , ab sciex ) Data were analyzed by ms using either lc  maldi - ms / ms ( abSciex) or ltq - ms. A list of 70 putative outer membrane - associated proteins ( presented in table 1 ) was culled from a larger list of 296 proteins identified in the outer membrane preparations. proteins for which no definitive annotation was available ( e.g. hypothetical protein) were kept on the list. assignments of a homo - oligomeric state were made by dividing the complex molecular weight estimated from native gel migration.  computational analysis was performed using curated gold standard sets of interacting and noninteracting pairs of proteins. The data set was curated to account for known differences between e. coli and d. vulgaris complexes. We excluded all interactions with ribosomal proteins as this complex is atypical due to the rna component. Pairing of d. vulgaris proteins to e. coli proteins was done using bidirectional best blast searches. All predicted protein sequences were queried against a database of protein sequences encoded by the e.coli k-12 mg1655 genome using blastp 2.2.9 with default options. We included all pairs of proteins that were present in a heteromeric complex in ecocyc but not observed to interact with each other. Pairs of proteins that were most significant hits for a query from the other genome were mapped to each other. We calculated a variety of scores that we expected would help distinguish true members of a heteromeric protein complex from false positives. Scores are defined as the number of times two proteins comigrated in a native band divided by the sum of individual appearances of the two proteins. We used a random forest classifier as implemented in the weka package. The classifier was then used to compute a score between zero ( not likely to interact) and one ( likely to interacted ) for all comigrating pairs. To estimate the effectiveness of the classifier on our data set we performed a 10-fold cross - validation.  membrane protein complexes were subjected to blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( bn - page ) to further isolate putative complexes. Proteins were extracted from native gel lanes by a second dimension of sds - page revealing putative complex subunits and their molecular weights. In the course of these studies we processed membranes derived from d. vulgaris cultures up to 50 l.  membrane protein complexes obtain a significant degree of protection from destabilization while in the protective environment of the lipid bilayer. We did not observe any significant differences in complexes obtained based on whether membranes were used directly or the proteins were isolated from flash - frozen membranes. We typically obtained about 0.1 g of wet membrane  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 per liter of cell culture. Proteins were eluted from these columns using a nacl step gradient. The fractions of each iex elution peak were of a sufficient protein concentration that they could be used directly for bn - page without the need for a concentration step prior to sample loading. This offered a significant advantage in maintaining protein stability as even incremental changes in protein concentration can increase the probability of aggregation. Molecular sieve chromatography did not notably improve separation of outer membrane samples. Running the gels slowly at lower voltages appeared to be beneficial for preserving protein complexes as they migrated through the gel. The native gel process used here generally followed those previously described. Band resolution and sensitivity could be improved by adjusting the coomassie blue g-250 levels. Gels for this study were prepared with samples isolated from a series of five d. vulgaris outer membrane preparations. Images of the native sample and molecular weight standard lanes were combined with images of the corresponding sds - page gels to assist in spot processing. spots appearing to originate from a common native gel band were classified as putative subunits of the same complex.  processing and analysis of the d. vulgaris outer  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 membrane sample sets yielded 296 protein identifications. Of the 296 proteins identified, 70 were designated as outer membrane - resident or associated. The most prevalent category of proteins detected in these outer membrane preparations is the lipoproteins. Most of the proteins identified ( 60 ) were detected as members of homomeric complexes with six proteins forming three heteromeric Complexes. efinitive annotations ( e.g. , hypothetical and conserved hypothetical ) is also relatively large , representing more than 30% of the outer membrane proteins identified here. Some of the proteins are not predicted to have transmembrane helices , barrel structures or  lipid anchors and instead may be membrane - associated through interactions with other proteins. A number of these proteins ( dvu0266 , 0273 , 0371 and 0851 ) have been proposed to play roles in stress response processes. Two - thirds of d. vulgaris outer membrane proteins are of low abundance. This may be due to losses incurred during the solubilization , chromatography and electrophoresis steps. Factors independent of abundance are also likely to have affected detection and identification of proteins. The number of different fragments produced for a given protein is a factor. Porins are channel - forming proteins found in the outer membranes of gram - negative bacteria. They are homotrimeric assemblies of large barrel subunits with each of the three subunits forming an independent channel. These complexes facilitate the entry and exit of a broad range of solutes. E. coli cross - linking studies found evidence of a dimer form of ompa fostered through peptides of the c - terminal periplasmic domain. Other proteins potentially important in the structural maintenance of the cell include two proteins ( dvu3104 , 2070) associating to form a complex corresponding to one from the e. coli tol - pal system. The largest number of such proteins were found participating in type  i secretion systems. Two d. vulgaris proteins ( dvu2373 and dvu1837) were homologues of subunits bama and bamd of the e. coli bam outer membrane protein assembly. A member of a predicted type ii secretion system, secretin dvu1273, was found as well. The presence of the periplasmic [ nifese ] and undetectable level of [ fe ] hydrogenase is as expected. We identified interacting pairs based on a conservative interpretation of our predictions. We used a cutoff that corresponded to a 53% false negative rate on our training set. We also expect to miss a significant number of true interactions. Among all proteins identified in these preparations, 104 were classified as participating in heteromeric protein interactions. The network of interactions among these proteins is depicted in figure 6. Monomers and homomeric complexes, although detected in the outer membrane, are not included. A small subset of our predicted interactions are expected to result from biologically irrelevant products of the isolation process. A few interactions with outer membrane and periplasmic proteins ( dvu1013 , 2070 , 1582 ) as well as between themselves were identified, albeit with lower confidence. The most abundant tolc family protein ( d Vu1013) displayed high - confidence interactions with two other outer membrane efflux proteins (dvu0062 and 3097 ) ( figure 6e ) . to the right of these clusters in the figure is a network formed around a protein annotated as hypothetical ( dnu0266 ) (figure 6o) ase components  secdfg ( dvu1819 , 1818 and 1676 ) and yajc ( d Vu1820 ) are strongly linked. It is difficult to predict with confidence the purpose of these interactions. One possibility is that a number of them may be proteins in the process of transport via the sec translocase. Another is that they may be providing support to proteins transiting the periplasmic space. A number of the proposed inner membrane subunits of these complexes were not detected in these preparations. The biochemical process employed in the present study was optimized specifically to maximize outer membrane protein extraction yield and maintain stability of solubilized protein complexes. An equivalent study on the inner membrane protein complexes of d. vulgaris will therefore be best approached selecting detergents and protocols optimized for this class of protein. A lipoprotein ( dvu2496) is seen to interact with an uncharacterized protein (dvu1455 ) that in turn interacts with the tetraheme cytochrome c3 ( d Vu0263 ) ( figure 6h) An inner membrane - anchored fusion protein (Dvu2815) was not detected in the complex possibly due to a low presence in the outer membrane preparations. The results of this outer membrane proteome  study demonstrate that mild isolation and purification procedures can produce a range of d. vulgaris membrane protein complexes. The results presented here suggest that this processing pipeline should be an effective tool for the high - throughput isolation and identification of membrane protein complexes. These data will facilitate the modeling of stress response pathways. The data needed to characterize stress - induced changes , such as those pertaining to relative abundance and protein these data , in turn , will facilitate  modeling of Stress Response Pathways.',\n",

The only observed finely roughened conidium was related to p. canescens, which had been isolated from soil. The study focused on morphology - based identification and sequencing of the -tubulin gene. The species of the penicillium section were strongly ( 93.1% ) well supported by bootstrap. Only p. chrysogenum and p. glabrum were isolated from all the examined isolates. There has been no extensive attempt at this type of study until now in iran. Parsimony analysis was used in our study to determine the phylogeny of the isolates. The penicillium section is substantially divided into five series including viridicata, camemberti, corymbifera, verrucosa , and solita. Only species related to two former series, such as p. melanoconidium and p. palitans, were isolated. Penicillium chrysogenum was the predominant agent among all assessed isolates in this study. This finding was concordant with other reports from around the world. This study reconfirmed the view that bt2 pcr - sequencing is a reliable and applicable diagnostic tool for differentiating and the molecular taxonomy of closely related peniillium species.',\n",
       " ' cachexia is a complex metabolic syndrome associated with underlying illness. It is characterized by loss of muscle with or without loss of fat mass. Anorexia , inflammation and increased muscle protein breakdown are frequently associated with wasting disease. The pre - cachectic population will be very heterogeneous, with some patients progressing rapidly but others remaining weight - stable. Cachexia is infrequently diagnosed due to the lack of clear cachectic markers. Some of the criteria used in the past include weight loss, decreased physical performance, fatigue, anorexia, and metabolic alterations. The present study is to fulfill the existing gap in the classification of cachectic cancer patients by introducing a new score that takes into consideration the stated parameters. The result is the newborn cachexia score ( casco) which classifies cachexia into mild ( 025), moderate ( 2650), severe ( 5175 ) and terminal ( 76100) The main components of casco are: body weight loss and composition, inflammation / metabolic disturbances / immunosupression, physical performance , anorexia , and quality of life. body weight lost and composition accounts for up 40% of the cachexia score ( table  2 ) The cachexia score ( casco) is a new tool for staging cachectic patients. The second component of casco is inflammation / metabolic disturbances / immunosupression ( imd) The immune response could also be a good indicator for a cachexia staging system.  physical performance accounts for up 15% of the cachexia score ( table  2 ) . a decrease in food intake promotes changes in quality of life and also conditions with many metabolic alterations. anorexia accounts for 15% and the last component of casco isquality of life. oxidative stress is clearly associated with cachexia , particularly in cancer. osupression , in addition to the cytokine measurement , a peripheral lymphocyte proliferation assay will be undertaken. This is particularly important since a previously stated immunosuppression may appear before any weight loss takes place. concerning physical performance , standard measurements for total activity , handgrip strength , stairs climb , or 6-min walk distance will be taken. points are assigned for the patient s answers as follows. The sum of the scores for the individual items constitutes the snaq score concerning quality of life. The questionnaire is presented in table  5 . it has been adapted from eortc qlq - c30 where questions related to physical performance or food intake have been withdrawn. There may be patients that, although they have not yet lost any significant weight ( less or equal to 5% in the last 12 months ) and are subjected to an underlying disease, may already have some of the peculiarities associated with cachexia. No consensus on how to classify the pre - cachectic patients has been reached. There is a clear need for high - quality international data , representative of the disease populations. A quantitative tentative ( not yet validated ) staging score for cancer cachectic patients is presented. Although mainly intended and designed for cancer patients, casco could also be tentatively used for other wasting disorders such as chronic heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. When validated , the new casco might prove to be a useful tool for the treatment and nutritional recommendations of cachectic cancer patients in a similar way as other staging methodologies.',\n",

       " 'Adenoid cystic carcinoma ( acc) was first used by spies in 1930. It is more common in the minor salivary glands ( > 25%) than in the major salivaries ( about 5%) acc is characterized by slow and relentless growth with a tendency for extensive local invasion. Most commonly followed the method of treatment for acc seems to be surgical resection combined with radiotherapy.  acc may require ultrasonography ( us ) , computed tomography ( ct ) , and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) for evaluating perineural , vascular , or skull base infiltration. Because ct is less accurate than mri for detecting the extent of disease , mri is preferred over ct. In case of bone pain, acc is best evaluated by using t1-weighted and fat - suppressed t2-weighting and gadolinium enhanced mri. A 64-year - old male patient presented with swelling of only 3-months duration and experienced mild pain. The peak incidence is seen during the fifth and sixth decades of life and shows a female predominance. Most of the patients with acc present with a mass, which has been there for months or years.  acc of sublingual glands is rare and tumors causing obstruction to submandibular duct are extremely rare. most common method of treatment for acc seems to be surgical resection combined with radiotherapy. long - term follow - up and newer biological markers of therapeutic potential are necessary to validate use of only surgery to manage tubular and cribriform accs.',\n",
       " 'hearing loss ( hl) is the most common sensory disorder estimated to affect 70 million people worldwide. this disorder is mostly a birth defect that affects 1 in 500 newborns. hl is extremely heterogeneous and can result from genetic or environmental factors or both. The extreme heterogeneity of hl makes it cumbersome to identify the genetic cause of this disease in single families. Myo15a encodes an unconventional myosin xva , which has a role in stereocilia formation ( 16 ) . myosins are molecular motor proteins that drive the moment of actin filaments via atp hydrolysis. premature stop mutations that result in loss of this domain cause dfnb3 hearing loss. Sixty - six exons of the myo15a gene [ nm_016239.3 ] and flanking regions were amplified using designed primers by the oligo ( ver ) Reaction conditions for amplifying exons in 50 l was as follows : 2 l mgcl2 ( 50 mm ) , 2.5 l pcr buffer ( 10x ) , 0.5 u taq dna polymerase ( 5u / ul ) , 1 l dntp mix ( 10 mm ) and 1 l genomic dna ( about 100 ng ) 30 iranian families with at least 2 affected children were selected. All cases of syndromic hearing loss caused by environmental factors such as ototoxic medications , hepatitis , head trauma , or meningitis were excluded. 5 ml peripheral blood , in tubes containing 0.5 m edta from all available members of all families was obtained. Dna quality ( purity and dna concentration) was checked by spectroscopy. Sixty - six exons of the myo15a gene [ nm_016239.3 ] and flanking regions were amplified using designed primers by the oligo ( ver) 30 iranian families with at least 2 affected children were selected. All families were informed and written consent was taken and consent was obtained from all family members. Dna quality ( purity and dna concentration) was checked by spectroscopy ( unico 2100 , usa ) ( 23 , 24 ) at least one affected member from every pedigree was selected for detection of gjb2 mutations. Reaction was carried out in accordance with previous protocols ( 25 ) . pcr product was run in an 8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( page ) at 45 ma for 1.5 hr. Most of the subjects in this study exhibited severe to profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. mutation 35delg was identified in 5 families out of 30 families by sequencing of the coding region of the gjb2 gene. The absence of new variation in 100 healthy control samples also confirmed the mutation performed by restriction fragment length polymorphism. Myo15a with 66 coding exons encodes an unconventional myosin that is expressed in the cochlea. this protein has important roles in the differentiation and elongation of the inner ear hair cell stereocilia. mutations that cause hearing loss were first identified at the dfnb3 locus in indonesia.  myth4/ferm domain in myoxva is essential for its localization to stereocilia tips. mutation leads to substitution of tryptophan for arginine amino acid at codon 2148. This amino acid substitution interferes with protein / microtubules interaction and actin and disrupts the normal auditory function.',\n",
       " \"rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) is a widespread chronic systemic inflammatory disorder that affects approximately 1% of the worldwide population. Pharmaceutical companies are interested in developing new anti - inflammatory treatments for the disease. This paper will focus on the role of p2x7 receptors in the pathophysiology of ra and the possible therapeutic connection of bisphosphonates with p2X7 receptor signaling. Atp appears to mediate internalization of p2x7 receptors in osteoclast - like cells. mechanical stimulation of osteoblasts leads to cell permeabilization via a mechanism dependent on p2-receptor signaling. purinergic signaling has been implicated in the pathophysiology of various bone and cartilage diseases.  il-1 is a potent stimulator of leukocytic infiltration, synovial hyperplasia, cell activation, cartilage breakdown and inhibition of cartilage matrix synthesis. interest in developing new drugs that target the synthesis, processing , and/or release of il -1 has risen in recent years. blocking antibodies for soluble il- 1 have been shown to reduce joint destruction in several animal models of arthritis. inflammatory syndromes , schnitzler 's syndrome , and gouty attacks. This treatment has been associated with liver toxicity. Long - term follow - up analyses are essential to guide appropriate management strategies. selective drug - like p2x7 receptor antagonists have already been tested in clinical trials for ra. R1 is involved in binding to bone mineral and r2 is responsible for its biological effects. Depending on the side - chain structure of r2, bisphosphonates are classified into nitrogen - containing bisph phosphonates and nonnitrogen - containing ones. Non - n - bisph phosphate is a major class of antiresorptive drug for the treatment of osteoporosis and paget 's disease. Clodronate and its physiological analogue pyrophosphate as a new molecule structure able to block il-1 release. This inhibition was also found by using high atp concentrations during macrophage polarization towards anti - inflammatory or alternatively activated m2 states. pyroph phosphates act to inhibit ros and cluster actin dynamics induced by other inflammasome activators ( e.g. maitotoxin ) In m1 macrophages, pyrophosphate and clodronate significantly inhibited gene expression dependent on nf-b activation. These effects could be mimicked and enhanced by the use of bisphosphonates as anti - inflammatory compounds. These compounds present various modes of action; for example, they deplete macrophage when administered encapsulated in liposomes. . with bisphosphonates could be more successful in treating chronic inflammation in ra . The drug could be used to treat chronic inflammation. in the body. It could also be used as part of a treatment for cancer. in cancer patients. The drug has been shown to reduce the risk of cancer.\",\n",

       " \" india is the largest producer of coconuts in the world ( annual production of 16,943 million nuts in 2010 - 2011 ) and the west coast tall variety is one of the major varieties cultivated there. copra is the dried coconut kernel with low moisture content ( 68% ) and is used to obtain coconut oil by expellers and organic solvents. sun - dried copra finds significant use in flavor and fragrance industries internationally. Coconut copra ( ball copra ) from west coast tall variety of coconuts were authenticated by coconut development board. Commercial coconut oil ( m / s kpl oil mills ( p ) ltd . , kerala , india ) was purchased from a local supermarket of kolkata ( control oil sample) The commercial oil had been extracted from coconut copra of west coasttall variety cultivated and harvested under similar conditions and the oil was obtained using expeller method. Aqueous and solvent extracts from copra were obtained in accordance with the method reported by odenigbo and otisi. For oils specific the viscosity ( pas ) of oils was measured using the brookfield digital dv - e synchro - electric viscometer. For coconut copra extracts and oils, both qualitative and quantitative analyses of their phytochemicals were conducted. The quantitative phytochemical analyses consisted of assays of antioxidant activity , total phenols , reducing power , and anti - inflammatory activities. The antioxidant activities of the extracts and the oils were determined by dpph assay in accordance with karakaya and imek. The fatty acid methyl ester ( fame ) of oils was prepared. Coconut copra contains 3.94% moisture, 1.59% ash, 71.62% crude fat, 8.80% crude protein, 7.15% crude fiber, and 6.90% carbohydrates. The yield of n - hexane extract ( 0.327  g / g dry copra ) of copra was higher than the aqueous extract. The physicochemical properties of coconut copra oil showed no significant differences between specific gravities of commercial oil and soxhlet extracted oil. The method of extraction did not significantly affect the specific gravity , ffa , and color of the oils. Glycosides had been coextracted from copra during aqueous and solvent extractions and in the oils during soxhlet extraction and expeller pressing. these were detected as red precipitates of moderate intensities using fehling 's solutions a and b. tannins , steroids , flavonoids , terpenoids , and acidic compounds were absent in both extracts. saponins and glycosides were present in moderate intensity and alkaloids and resins in low intensity in both the oils.  flavonoids, tannins, steroids, terpenoids, and acidic compounds were absent both in the extracts and in the oils. phytochemical analyses of copra extracts and oils showed highest antioxidant activity in commercial oil. highest reducing potential was found in commercialOil ( 40.49  1.84 mg bht eq./g dry copra) Commercial copra oil ( experimental control) showed best antioxidant, total phenol , anti - inflammatory , and reducing power activities. This was followed by the oil obtained by soxhlet assembly, aqueous extract , and n - hexane extracts of copra. A high correlation ( r = 0.99 ) between antioxidant activity and reduced power was obtained in our study. This correlation was in agreement with that reported by rakov et al. The most abundant fatty acid was lauric acid ( c12:0 ) in the oil samples ( 44.84% in commercial oil and 51.88% in soxhlet extracted oil ) medium chain fatty acids were found to be most predominant in the coconut oil samples. These oils do not meet the recommendation of the american heart organization which suggests 1 of sfa :  mufa  :  pufa in edible fats. Mechanical extraction is more suitable method of oil extraction than solvent extraction. Saturated fats are used in several food applications such as in confectionary and bakery products. We envisage potential applications of the expeller - pressed coconut copra oil in novel product development.\",\n",

The mortality rate for all patients was 24.5% , with a higher mortality rate. for patients with severe sepsis ( 29.2% ) or septic shock ( 62.2%) Among 505 isolated samples, 92 ( 18.2% ) isolates were positive for bc. sex , infection sites , and the presence of enterobacteriaceae infection did not affect the mortality of the patients. more than one microorganism was found in 4 ( 4.3% ) episodes after the bc , with b. cepacia being present in two episodes. The pct concentration and endotoxin level significantly differed among the four groups g, g , fungi , and bc ( p < 0.000 , pct ; and p = 0.0244 , endotoxin ) The pct level was significantly higher in the g group than in the bc and g groups. No significant difference was found between g group and the bc ( or g ) group. The level of pct is more closely associated with gn bacteremia than that of endotoxin. gn bacteria were predominant within the microorganisms found in the bcs. The major gram - positive bacteria were from coagulase - negative staphylococci. Age, comorbidities, severities at admission and status of bacterenmia differ significantly between survivors and nonsurvivors. B. cepacia was found to have the highest positive rate among all the microorganism species. In some countries , gram - positive bacteria may have a high percentage of microorganisms found in the bcs. The difference in the predominant bacterial type may result from geographic variation , case mix , and antibiotic prescription habits. Pct has been widely used as a sepsis biomarker for discriminating bacterial and nonbacterial infections and to predict bacteremia with different statuses. Different bacterial species or different genomovars within the same species b. cepacia differ in their ability to cause life - threatening pneumonia and possess different lipid a structures. We found that gn was predominant within the microorganisms found in the bcs of the icu patients.',\n",
       " 'The amide bond is widely prevalent in both naturally occurring and synthetic compounds. It is present in 25% of available drugs, with amidation reactions being among the most commonly used reactions in medicinal chemistry. There is considerable interest in the development of new approaches to direct amidation, and there have been many recent developments in this field.  b(ome)3 was useful for amidation in some cases. The 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol - derived ester b(och2cf3)3 gave consistently higher conversions. A solid phase purification procedure has been developed that enables the amide products to be obtained without aqueous workup or chromatography. The amidation of phenylacetic acid with benzylamine was selected as a test reaction. The reaction mixture contains the amide product, borate - ester derived byproducts, and potentially some unreacted amine and/or carboxylic acid. The reactions were purified by acid and base washes to remove these impurities. The full scope of the amidation reactions was explored with a wide range of amines and carboxylic acids. Primary amines including benzylamines and simple aliphatic amines could be coupled in good yield. A range of cyclic secondary amines also underwent amidation efficiently, including several medicinally relevant examples ( 2i2 m) The preparation of n - benzylamides ( figure 3 , 3a3v) was explored. The coupling of a selection of other combinations of acids and amines was also explored. All reactions were carried out at 80 c for 5 h, and the solid phase workup procedure was used unless otherwise stated. Reaction of nucleophilic aniline with an unsaturated acid proceeded in good yield ( 4f) monoamidation of a dicarboxylic  acid could also be achieved in 53% yield. All reactions were carried out at 80 c for 5 h unless otherwise stated and purified by solid phase workup. B(och2cf3)3-mediated amidation reactions can be easily purified by a solid phase workup. The successful amidation of amino acids using boronic acid catalysts or other boron - based amidation reagents has not been reported to date. In most cases no significant racemization was observed ( 6a, 6b, 6d) where  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 small levels of racemized were observed, this could be reduced significantly by decreasing the reaction time. Coupling of amino acids with secondary amines using conventional coupling reagents is often a considerable challenge, and an aqueous work up and/or chromatographic purification is generally required. Our method offers a potentially valuable approach to tertiary amino acid amides. It furnishes pure products in reasonable yield with high enantiopurity following a simple solid phase workup.  b(och2cf3)3 was highly effective for the transamidation of dmf. The reaction was more effective with small quantities of dMf in acetonitrile as solvent. Although reasonable yields were obtained with as little as 1 equiv of d mf, the use of 10 equiv was found to be optimal. Formylation of benzylamine could also be achieved with similar efficiency using formamide ( 88% yield ) and n - methylformamide ( 94% ) However, dmf is considerably cheaper and easier to separate from the formamide product than these alternative formyl donors. A wide range of acids and amines containing varying functionalities can be successfully used in b(och2cf3)3-mediated amidation reactions. The pure amide products can be isolated following an operationally simple solid phase workup procedure. All resins were washed with ch2cl2 and dried under a vacuum prior to use. column chromatography was carried out using silica gel and analytical thin layer chromatography used aluminum - backed silica plates. components were visualized using combinations of uv ( 254 nm ) and potassium permanganate.  b(och2cf3)3 ( 2.0 mmol , 2 equiv) was added to a solution of acid and amine in mecn ( 2 ml , 0.5 m ) The reaction mixture was stirred at the indicated temperature ( 80 c , or 100 c in a sealed tube ) for the indicated time ( 524 h ) after the indicated  time , the reaction  mixture was diluted with ch2cl2 or etoac ( 3 ml ) and water. amberlyst a-26(oh ) ( 150 mg ) and amberlite ira743 (150 mg ) were added to the reaction mixture and it was stirred for 30 min. mgso4 was added  to the mixture , which For amides 2i, 2j, 2 t, 2u and 4e, amberlyst 15 was not used. The residue was redissolved in ch2cl2 and washed with aqueous solutions of nahco3 and hcl. It was dried over mgso4 and then filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to give the amide product.

       " 'Cancer formation is generally considered as a genetic disease involving alterations in dna structure. dysregulation of gene expression can also be acquired by epigenetic abnormalities. Inactivation of tumor suppressor genes by promoter hypermethylation provides an important mechanism for tumor initiation and progression. The concordance rates in monozygotic and dizygotic pairs of twins allow one to estimate the heritability of complex phenotypic traits. In 1982 8 mo one sister was diagnosed with precursor b - cell lymphoblastic leukemia ( icd10:c910 ) . chemotherapy had to be discontinued because of intolerability. A first relapse of the leukemia occurred in 1984 . the second chemotherapy could be completed , but another relapse made bone marrow transplantation from her healthy twin sister necessary. Fibroblasts were used for epimutation screening because they constitute a homogenous cell population with intact cell cycle and dna repair checkpoints. induction of dna damage by -irradiation ( 1 gy ) of primary fibroblast cultures did not affect the brca1 methylation levels. In the affected twin , we found 10% methylation at 0 h , 10% at 1 h , 9% at 4 h , 11% at 12 h , and 10% after irradiation. 40 - seven clones ( individual dna molecules ) were recovered from primary fibroblasts of each twin. Six ( 13% ) clones of the affected twin exhibited epimutations, indicating that most ( at least 70% ) cpg sites were aberrantly methylated. In contrast, all 47 alleles of the healthy twin displayed normal hypomethylated patterns. Both sisters showed approximately 2% stochastic ( single cpg ) methylation errors. Brca1 protein levels were also quantified in fibroblast cells at 1 h and 4 h after 1 gy -irradiation. Brca1 expression was slightly increased ( 1.25 ) in the affected twin , whereas actb ( positive control ) , brca2 , mlh1 , rad51 , and tp53 all showed comparable protein levels in both twins. Microarray analysis revealed a 181 kb heterozygous deletion containing the rspo3 gene on chromosome 6q22.33 and a 90kb heterozygOUS deletion containing c5orf13 on chromosome 5q 22.1 in primary fibroblasts of the affected twin. We did not see similar deletions in > 40 additionally studied childhood cancer patients and 100 normal healthy individuals ( from the gutenberg heart study ) . we did not find evidence for a microdeletion or duplication affecting the brca1 cis - regulatory region in the affected twins. Microarray - based karyotype analyses revealed somatic mosaicism for copy number variations ( cnvs) in a number of phenotypically discordant mz twin pairs. We propose that epigenetic changes , specifically hypermethylation of one brca1 allele constituted the first hit leading to inactivation of an important tumor suppressor gene.  index patient developed precursor b - cell lymphoblastic leukemia at the age of 4 y and 8 mo. leukemia , expression of the bcr - abl fusion protein leads to posttranscriptional downregulation of brca1. One study reported partial hypermethylation and reduced expression of Brca1 in primary and therapy - related acute myeloid leukemia. The two - cancer twin showed reduced basal brca1 protein levels ( in untreated fibroblasts ) and a higher induction of protein expression by dna damage. The basal atm protein levels were also increased in the affected twin. Both twins showed equally low promoter methylation levels ( around 1% ) of the atm gene. Although we can not exclude the formal possibility of a chance coincidence or a late ( i.e. , therapy - related ) somatic event , it is more likely that atm is constitutively upregulated. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the medical association of rhineland - palatinate [ ( nr . 837.440.03(4102 ) ] . with the help of the german childhood cancer registry , we recruited a discordant mz twin pair. One twin suffered from childhood leukemia and later on thyroid carcinoma , whereas her twin sister was completely healthy ( without malignancy ) A 3.4kb fragment on chromosome 17 ( 41.277.11241.530 bps ) was divided into 11 amplicons. The pcr reaction mixture ( 25 l) consisted of 2.5 l 10x pcr buffer, 20 mm mgcl2 , 0.5L 10 mm dntp mix, 1 l ( 10 pmol ) of each forward and reverse primer, 0.2 l ( 1 u ) faststart taq dna polymerase, 18.8 l pcr - grade water, and 1 l template dna. genomic dna from fibroblasts and ebv - transformed lymphoblasts was extracted using the qiagen mini dna kit. saliva dna was extracted Brca1 pcr products were cloned into pcr2.1-topo vector using t4-dna ligase and one shot top10 chemically competent escherichia coli. Plasmid dna of individual clones was isolated with the zr plasmid miniprep classic kit. insert - containing clones were sequenced using dye terminator cycle sequencing with m13 primers. . nuclear proteins were labeled with an amine reactive fluorine dye , which forms a covalent amide bond between the primary amines of proteins. antibodies against -actin ( actb ) ( # a5441 , sigma - aldrich , munich , germany ) served as positive , spotting buffer as negative control. antibody microarrays were covered with 16-pad fast frame hybridization chambers ( whatman , maidstone , uk ) . unspecific binding sites were blocked for 1 h at 4c with 120 l pbs containing 4% non - fat dry milk per subarray. Finally, the slides were washed two times for 15 min with pbs , 5% tween 20 and two  slide images were analyzed using the tm4 spotfinder ( version 3.1.1 ) software. Three biological replicates ( using protein samples from different cell cultures of the affected and the healthy twin ) were performed for each experiment.

       " 'Nonosseous spinal tuberculoma is extremely rare. 64% of tuberculomas are extradural, 8% are intramedullary, and 1% are extramedulary. The rest ( 27% ) of the lesions involve the arachnoid without dural involvement. Tuberculoma is a chronic inactive fibrotic scar with calcification. During the operation there was a clear dissection plane between the mass and the spinal cord except in the stalk portion of the mass. One month after the surgery , he did not complain the gait abnormality and urinary difficulty any more. tuberculosis is diagnosed definitely by identifying the causative organism in a clinical sample.  intradural extramedullary tuberculomas are usually associated with tb meningitis12,14 ) this disease seems to also affect young people more commonly and is associated with subacute spinal cord compression. The patient had symptoms several months after anti - tb medications , but he did not undergo further spinal evaluation such as mr imaging.  intradural extramedullary tuberculoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of subacute or chronic spinal cord compression in a relatively young patient with the history of pulmonary tb or tb meningitis. a paradoxical reaction may occur after the initiation of anti - tb medication. surgical resection will enhance the possibility for a successful outcome if myelopathic symptoms occur.',\n",
       " 'The worldwide prevalence of this syndrome is approximately 1/1,000,000 individuals. mutations in the runt - related transcription factor 2 ( runx2 ) gene are responsible for approximately two thirds of ccd patients. patients are generally referred for treatment due to delayed dental development along with the appearance of a short stature, midface dysplasia, and sloping shoulders. Primary teeth were retained in the mixed dentition, except for the right maxillary deciduous lateral incisor and canine. The radiopaque mass in the left maxillary premolar region appeared to be an odontoma together with five supernumerary teeth. The mandibular central incisors and first molars in all four quadrants were the only erupted permanent teeth in this 20-year - old female patient. The patient presented with some remarkable and rare dental anomalies that were found on panoramic and cbct images. These anomalies included a previously undiagnosed odontoma and previously unreported fused primary teeth. There was also the unusual presence of 14 supernumerary teeth and a cystic lesion. A diagnosis of ccd was made based on the clinical and radiographic examinations.  cysts derive from epithelial cells in oral tissues, such as the remnants of odontogenic epithelium in tooth follicles and the epithelial lining of the oral mucosa. The prevalence of fused teeth in the primary dentition is approximately 1%. 74% of the successional lateral incisors are absent. Park et al.16 designed a multidisciplinary treatment protocol for the dentofacial manifestations of ccd. The plan involved prosthetic treatment following the extraction of some primary teeth with root resorption and pulpal lesions. The treatment was aimed at restoring the function and aesthetics of the dentition. stic lesion . this report described some novel clinical manifestations of ccd. It emphasized the importance of cbct assessment and early dental interventions in the treatment of this disease. The report was published in the Journal of the American Dental Association (JADA) in October 2013.',\n",
       " 'desmoid tumours comprise 0.03% of all neoplasms and less than 3% of soft tissue tumours. They are more common in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis ( fap) where the incidence is 850 times higher than in the general population ( 3) Most desmoids tend to grow slowly and do not metastasise , although their growth pattern remains quite aggressive. Desmoid tumours are benign and characterised by a monoclonal fibroblastic proliferation typically arising from muscular or aponeurotic structures. high recurrence rates and difficult locations make treatment of the intra - abdominal sub - group particularly difficult. surgery remains the main therapeutic option , with complete tumour resection providing the only potentially curative treatment. High recurrence rate can be reduced by adjuvant and / or neoadjuvant radiotherapy. radio frequency ablation is currently under scrutiny. Other options include placement of a percutaneous catheter for use in chemical ablation using acids. desmoid tumours are rare and are either found sporadically or more commonly associated with fap.',\n",
       " 'The patient had no relevant medical history and had not traveled abroad during the previous year. The patient was treated with 12 g / day intravenous amoxicillin and acyclovir. On day 4 , the patient exhibited hypotonic tetraplegia with no osteotendinous reflexes. ten days later, rapid motor improvement of lower extremities was observed. We describe the first case of tickborne encephalitis in southwestern france. High levels of tbev igm were observed in serum and csf samples, as is usually observed in tbe neurologic cases. No virus was isolated and no genome detected. No dermatologic signs characteristic of lyme disease were visible. 3 cases were reported from the french alpen region ( 5 ) likely linked to goat cheese consumption. The discovery of the first tbe case in southwestern france raises the question of the mode of emergence of the virus in this region. The viral cycle involves mainly rodents or deer and ticks with humans as accidental hosts.',\n",
       " 'The approach usually taken by the general population to phytomedicine is that such a therapy is natural and therefore safe. Several studies have demonstrated that this statement is not true. Two cases of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis ( adem ) after exposure to intravenous herbal extracts have been reported. The patient developed generalized tonic clonic seizures requiring anti - convulsant therapy , sedation and mechanical ventilation. The tissue harbored a considerable immune cell infiltrate including significant numbers of t cells that were distributed throughout the tissue. The finding of foamy histiocytes , together with an intense t cell ( and to a lesser extent b cell ) infiltrate within the lesions , points to an autoreactive immune mechanism towards myelin. The exact factors that trigger autoimmunity have not yet been identified. ambient insults are thought to play a major role. The long tradition and presumed natural origin of herbal medicines do not translate to a guarantee for treatment safety. severe adverse reactions account for over one third of the undesired effects.',\n",
       " 'spinal muscular atrophy ( sma) is characterized by motor neuron degeneration. sma exhibits an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Most sma patients harbor deletions, mutations, or conversions of the survival motor neuron gene ( smn1) smn has been the most important therapeutic target for development of sma treatment. The smn protein can form granules that are transported and associated with -actin mrna in neuronal processes. sma mouse models have been generated through mouse smn knockout and human smn2 transgenic methods. These mice reveal spinal motor neuron degeneration , muscle atrophy , and impaired motor performances.  smn levels generally correlate with disease severity in sma patients and mouse models. smn is the best therapeutic target for development of sma treatment. until now, there are still no drugs that have shown consistent benefits in clinical trials. finding an effective treatment with distinct therapeutic mechanisms is necessary for future sma therapy. Vpa upregulates antiapoptotic factors such as bcl-2 and bcl - xl. Vpa reduced motor neuron degeneration, muscle atrophy, and motor dysfunction in sma mice. Large clinical trials did not confirm the beneficial effects of vpa on sma patients. Intravenous aav serotype 9 ( aav9) injection has shown success in affecting widespread gene delivery in entire spinal cord. Sma mice showed a robust increase in lifespan by 880% with less motor neuron degeneration and abnormal architectures of neuromuscular junction. However, augmented smn is expressed in thoracolumbar regions , but sparse in the cervical cord.  igf-1 treatment has been shown to improve disease phenotypes in rodent models of motor neuron diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als )  and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy ( sbma ) for sma, transgenic expression of igF-1 in skeletal muscle of sma mice resulted in an increase in myofiber size and a modest improvement in median survival. However, intracerebellar viral delivery of igf -1 reduced motor neuron degeneration , but did not improve motor function in the mildly affectedSma mice. Cntf and cardiotrophin-1 ( ct-1) bind a common receptor complex requiring leukemia inhibitory factor receptor ( lifr ) and gp130. Cntf is essential in normal motor neuron development and is also able to support long - term survival of motor neurons as demonstrated in culture cells and rats with axotomy. In sma mice, intramuscular injection of adenoviral vector expressing ct -1 prolonged survival , delayed motor defects and diminished motor axonal degeneration. Riluzole is the only disease - modifying therapy available for als. The precise neuroprotective mechanisms remain largely speculative. In sma mice , however, a small phase i clinical trial demonstrated no significant differences in survival and the change in motor abilities after riluzol treatment. The pharmacokinetics of rluzole in sma patients has recently been investigated. Salbutamol promoted exon 7 inclusion in smn2 transcripts and thus increased levels of full - length transcripts of smn1 in sma fibroblasts. In sma patients, daily salbutaml significantly and consistently increased smn 2 full -length transcript levels in peripheral leukocytes. The response was directly proportional to smn3 gene copy number. The mechanism of action of 2-adrenergic agonists on human skeletal muscles is not completely understood. Plastin-3 is a regulator of actin filament organization and is expressed in almost all solid tissues, including the human brain, spinal cord, and muscles. plastin -3 colocalizes with smn in granules throughout motor neuron axons. PlastIn-3 protein levels are reduced in brain and spinal cord of an sma mouse model.  cpg15 mrna colocalizes with smn protein in axons and is locally translated in growth cones. smn may serve as a modifier of sma disease by regulating axon extension and axon terminal differentiation. rho - kinase activation is associated with dendritic simplification and reduced spine length and density. Stem cell therapy might provide a possibility for cell replacement. fetal - derived neural stem cells ( nscs) can be isolated from mouse embryonic spinal cords and differentiated toward a motor neuron cell fate by priming with retinoic acid and sonic hedgehog. Although some grafted cells expressed motor neuron markers , there was no direct evidence suggesting the beneficial effects resulting from the formation of functional motor units by the transplanted cells. Evidence of newly generated motor neuron outgrowth to the muscles. Use of drug - selectable embryonic stem cell lines that ganciclovir and g418 have been applied for selection against undifferentiated embryonic stem cells and for neuroepithelial cells. ips cells provide a novel opportunity in disease modeling for investigating sma pathogenesis and can be used in screening novel compounds for sma treatment. For autologous ips cell transplantation in sma , ips - derived neural precursor cells or motor neurons should be pretreated to express a high level of smn before transplantation. smn acts to modulate and correct the neuromuscular junction for functional improvement. Smn - independent targets could play a role of extension in the survival of motor neurons and reduce the influence ofSmn depletion in axonal dynamics.',\n",
       " 'Oral myiasis is a condition in which there is an infestation of living mammals with dipterous larvae. larvae feed on living or dead tissue in the host and develop as parasites. The most commonly affected sites are the nose, eyes, skin wounds, sinuses and lungs. Om may present as oral mucosal swelling, gingival inflammation, laceration, ulceration, periodontal disease, non - healing extraction wound, jaw bone fracture and secondary infestation to cancrum oris. Myiasis in human beings is caused by many species of larvae belonging to the order diptera. The female adult cb fly lays around 150200 eggs on exposed wounds of mucous membranes of the nose , mouth and ear. The eggs hatch after 24 hours and the larvae thrive on living tissues for 57 days. Local application of several substances will help remove all the larvae. oral myiasis can be prevented by controlling fly population and maintaining personal and oral hygiene.',\n",
       " 'Patients with copd are characterized by dyspnea and physical exercise intolerance. These impair their ability to participate in physical activities and contribute to poor health - related quality of life ( hrqol) The effectiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation ( pr ) for these patients has been amply demonstrated. Emerging therapies like transcutaneous neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( nmes ) can also be used. Home - based nmes on hrqol has not yet been examined in patients with moderate copd. A home - based pr with nmes was proposed to 71 patients with copd experiencing dyspnea during daily living activities. Six patients in gnmes were dropped from the program for the following reasons: death, exacerbation, lack of motivation, and hospitalization. This individual home - based pr consisted of 90-minute sessions once a week based on an educational needs assessment. It comprised endurance physical exercise for guepe , nmes for gnmes and resumption of the physical activities of daily living. The patients self - administered nmes to the bilateral quadriceps with surface electrodes. The field exercise test is feasible for patients with pulmonary disease,14,17,19 and it detects improved functional capacity after pr in patients with copd. to carry out in the patient s home , the 6mst was performed as previously described. The stepper ( go sport , grenoble , france ) was placed near a wall to support patients if they became unbalanced or exhausted. at the end of the test , al , a minimal clinically important difference ( mcid ) of 40 steps has been proposed. A home - based pr with nmes was proposed to 71 patients with copd experiencing dyspnea during daily living activities ( group nmes : gnmes ) between 2012 and 2014. One hundred and seventeen patients were eligible for this routine clinical practice. exclusion criteria were dementia or poorly controlled psychiatric illness, neurological sequelae , or bone and joint diseases preventing physical activity. The intervention program is detailed in figure 1 . briefly , as described elsewhere, it consisted of 90-minute sessions once a week based on an educational needs assessment. this home - based pr lasted for 6 weeks for gnmes13 nmes and 8 weeks for guepe. in gnmes , the patients self - administered nmes to the bilateral quadriceps with surface electrodes. for practical reasonsquadriceps was selected because deficits in strength of this muscle are frequently observed in the patients with copd. a portable , user - friendly , dual - channel nmes stimulator was used. The patients performed the timed up - and - go test,16 which requires no specific equipment and is easy to execute at home. The 6mst was performed as previously described. Three upper and lower limb muscle strengthening exercises were systematically proposed ( with instruction sheets ) , lasting 1015 minutes per day. The vsrq is a valid and reliable questionnaire to assess hrqol. It comprises eight visual analog scales ranging from 0 to 10 with a total score of 80. For anthropometric and spirometric data, a general linear model with a two - way design was used to compare the groups and examine the effect of the severity of airflow limitation. Three or more comorbidities were found for 82% and 76% patients in gnmes and guepe. The patients with severe copd were older compared with patients with moderate airflow limitation. Body mass index ( bmi) was significantly lower in patients with very severeCopd regardless of the group. Nmes at home improves exercise tolerance8,10,13,25 and hrqol in a large population with copd. napolis et al reported no significant effect of home - based nmes on exercise tolerance in 30 patients with moderate to very severe airflow obstruction. our results suggest that nmes may be recommended even to copd patients with severe exercise intolerance regardless of the airflow obstruction or value of bmi. In severely disabled patients with copd, vivodtzev et al showed an increase in muscle strength and endurance ( on the quadriceps and calf muscles ) after an nmes program. These major findings suggest that nmes reduces muscle protein degradation and enhances protein synthesis , which promotes a net gain in muscle mass. The current observational study reveals that nmes significantly improves exercise tolerance, depression , and overall hrqol in patients with copd. A controlled trial randomized for physical capacity regardless of the copd severity is recommended to confirm our results. Home - based pr including self - monitored nmes seems to be feasible and effective in severely disabled individuals who are unable to perform the uepes.',\n",
       " \"i refer the reader to several fine reviews on avian skin epithelial stem cells. The epidermis maintains a single inner ( basal ) layer of proliferative cells that adhere to an underlying basement membrane rich in ecm and growth factors. periodically, these cells withdraw from the cell cycle , commit to differentiate terminally , move outward , and are eventually shed from the skin surface. The epidermal proliferative unit ( epu) has been architecturally defined as a bed of 10 tightly packed basal cells. This has led to the hypothesis that there is one self - renewing stem cell per epu. The other basal cells are so - called transit - amplifying ( ta ) cells that divide several times and then exit the basal layer.  renewing stem cells ( scs) exist in the basal layer of the epidermis. symmetrical divisions produce two stem cells, a process which can serve to replenish vacancies. asymmetrical divisions accounted for 70% of all basal cell mitoses in mouse embryonic skin. etric and symmetric , but , in this case, only 30% occurred at an angle of > 20 relative to the basement membrane. The committed daughter cell asymmetrically inherits a stronger notch signal. The daughter inheriting the notch signal would differentiate , detach from the underlying basement membrane , and enter the spinous layer. The basement membrane is also composed of a rich array of ecm polymers and growth factors that provide a complex repertoire of stimuli for basal cells. Among them is laminin 5 , which promotes anchorage and signaling / migration through its respective abilities to act as ligand for 64-rich hemidesmosomes and 31-rich fas. The basement membrane plays an integral role in controlling the ability of basal epidermal stem cells to maintain homeostasis under normal and injury conditions. When this regulation goes awry, there is an increased propensity to developing squamous cell carcinoma. One transcription factor that is likely to play a key role in regulating the self - renewal and long - term proliferative capacity of the stem cell is p63. Mice lacking p63 are severely impaired in their ability to generate the epidermis. Clonal analyses on cultured thymic epithelial and epidermal cells suggest that when p63 mrna is knocked down through small hairpin rnas the cells form smaller colonies with reduced proliferation rates. experiments on human epider mal raft cultures suggest that p63 's function in basal cells is mediated by its ability to inhibit its relative p53. Fig. 3 shows the predicted roles of notch signaling in the three different lineages of the epidermis. The arrows denote molecular steps along the pathways for each of the three major epithelial lineages. immunofluorescence microscopy was used on frozen mouse skin sections of e18.5 (epidermis) and postnatal day 28 (hair follicle bulb) to illustrate the localization of notch3, hes1 , and hey1. A role for notch as the gatekeeper of the commitment of basal epidermal cells to terminally differentiate is particularly intriguing in light of a notch inhibitor , numb , which functions as an intrinsic cell fate determinant. The action appears to converge at the base of the epidermis between the basal and first suprabasal layers. The scales of a fish , the horn of a rhinocerous , the claws of an eagle , the mane of a lion and the sweat ( eccrine ) and oil ( sebaceous ) glands of our skin are all epider mal appendages. ymal component of the hair follicle. at approximately embryonic day ( e ) 14.5 of mouse development, mesenchymal  epithelial interactions result in the formation of the first wave of hair placodes. once initiated, these placodes undergo marked proliferation and downgrowth to produce first the hair germs ( e15.5 ) and then hair pegs ( e16.517) The first wave of follicle morphogenesis, resulting in formation of the large primary guard hairs, diverges somewhat from the second. This first wave is dependent on a tnf - like ligand  receptor complex composed of ectodysplasin ( eda ) and eda receptor. This receptor complex, instead of inducing noggin , induces two different bmp inhibitors. inhibition of bmp signaling is permissive for lef1 expression and promotes the stabilization of -catenin. Sonic hedgehog ( shh) is an early gene expressed downstream of wnt / bmp receptor ( bmpr ) signaling. Shh plays a critical role in organizing the dermal cells into a condensate , or dp , which thereafter becomes a permanent component of the hair follicle. Once understood , this process is likely to be relevant to other morphogenetic processes. In mice, backskin follicles remain dormant for 12 d in the first resting phase ( telogen ) but then rest for > 3 wk in the second telogen. A cluster of stem cells at the base of the bulge become activated to proliferate. The offspring of a single bulge stem cell can form sgs and epidermis as well as new hair follicles. Most bulge cells appear to be in a state of wnt inhibition in telogen. stabilized -catenin is a feature of activated stem cells. When stabilized -Catenin depletion in adult skin can not be maintained, the new hair cycle does not reinitiate. The loss of bmpr1a results in the precocious entry of follicles into anagen. when the gene encoding bmpr1a is conditionally targeted for depletion in adult follicles in telogen phase , bulge stem cells become activated. activated, tumors develop that are composed of a center of hair shaft cells surrounded by matrix - like cells expressing nuclear lef1/-catenin ( gat et al . , 1998) Dp cells typically rests at the base of the bulge in telogen follicles and expresses several bmp inhibitory factors and wnts that are candidates for follicle stem cell activation. It is not clear precisely what this inductive signal is. In the whisker cycle of rodents , the dp never reaches the Bulge before the start of a new anagen. It has been proposed that stem cells from the bulges therefore migrate along the ors to the follicle , where they become activated. Blimp1 is used to induce sg hyperplasia and sebocyte differentiation at the expense of hair follicle differentiation. If blimp1 truly marks the progenitor / stem cell population of the sg, why do n't the enlarged glands eventually recede in blimpe1 's absence? The underlying explanation could be rooted in the ability of the bulge to become mobilized when the sG progenitors are depleted. The mobilization of stem cells to exit their niches and either form a hair follicle or repair wounds may entail the remodeling of intercellular junctions. One intriguing aspect is the up - regulation of 6 integrin and the presence of the v6 integrin ligand , tenascin c , in the bulge stem cells as they transit from telogen to anagen. similar changes are seen in the epidermal basal layer in response to injury. c might control the conversion of stem cells to so - called ta ( i.e. committed ) cells. ovol1 is another transcriptional repressor of c - myc that may act to prevent proliferation after ta cells commit to terminally differentiate. notch controls selective cell fate determination through close - range interactions not only in the epidermis but also in the hair follicle and the sg. Growth factor receptor signaling appears to affect different keratinocyte stem cell populations in distinct ways. The existence of different skin stem cell compartments and the ability of these niches to respond differentially to environmental cues has been an exciting new development in the field. increasing knowledge about these stem cell populations over the past 5 yr has begun to shed light on the similarities and differences among them. Are these different stem cell population multipotent , as recent experiments by ito et al . ( 2007 ) suggest ? is the multipotency of stem cells in response to wounding a reflection of mechanical disruption of the niche or a response to growth / differentiation factors released in a wound response ? to what extent do the gene expression programs of other progenitor populations overlap with that of follicle stem cells ?\",\n",
       " 'Sodium nitroprusside ( snp) is often used in pediatric intensive care units because of its strongly antihypertensive properties. cyanide toxicity , the most lethal complication , can occur after snp treatment. exchange transfusion can be useful in poisoning cases because it activates the detoxification systems and removes some of the toxic agents from the blood. The infant was admitted to the hospital with high anion gap metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory alkalosis. On the ninth day of admission, the respiratory rate increased gradually and the patient showed symptoms of air hunger, moaning sound, nasal flaring , and irritability. The infant was discharged from the hospital on the 20th day after hospitalization without any neurological deficits. Cyanide intoxication should be considered if unexplained tachypnea, tachycardia, lactic acidosis , irritability , and seizures occur after snp administration. Children and neonates may be more susceptible to cyanide toxicity because of lower thiosulfate storage levels. A key strategy to manage cyanide poisoning is to administer sulfur donors.  exchange transfusion causes complications in 5% to 10% of infants even though the risk of death from the procedure is only 0.3/100 procedures. cyanide poisoning causes cessation of oxidative phosphorylation and induces histotoxic anoxia, especially of the central nervous and cardiovascular systems. At high levels , it can lead to death.',\n",
       " 'Acute lung injury ( ali ) and acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards) are life - threatening syndromes that cause high morbidity and mortality. No specific therapies are available and the disease outcome has yet to be improved by pharmacologic treatments. The identification of new molecules that can modulate ali - associated inflammation is highly desirable and is a significant goal of pharmaceutical companies. Ellagic acid demonstrated potent anti - inflammatory effects. It accelerated the resolution of inflammation and decreased the exacerbation of the inflammation process caused by selective cox-2 inhibition. Taken together, these results suggest the potential of ellagic acid as a candidate for the treatment of ali - associated inflammation. In a fourth cohort, the animals were pretreated with a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 ( cox-2 ) ( celebra , 10  mg / kg ; intraperitoneal route ) 30  min prior to the intratracheal acid instillation. The animals were then treated with the ellagic acid or the vehicle ( 2, 24 , and 47  h after the acid - initiated injury ) as a positive control. The mice were euthanised by sodium pentobarbital overdose and the balf and lung were collected. Total cell and differential leukocyte counts were made according to rogerio et al . We first evaluated the preventive effect of ellagic acid ( 10  mg / kg , p.o . ) on the acid - initiated acute lung inflammation. The total cells, neutrophils, macrophages , and lymphocytes were quantified from the balf. The lungs of the vehicle - treated mice demonstrated increased edema, thickening of the alveolar septum and interstitium , and leukocyte infiltration compared to the control group. The mice were treated with ellagic acid or the vehicle control at 2, 24, 47, or 71  h after lung injury. The numbers of total cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages in the vehicle - treated mice significantly increased compared to the saline control group. No significant alteration was observed in the lymphocytes numbers by bothEllagic acid and dexamethasone at all of the time points analyzed. Ellagic acid and dexamethasone treatment increased the levels of il-10 by approximately eight- and elevenfold , respectively, compared to the saline control group. We next assessed the therapeutic effect of ellagic acid on the exacerbated inflammatory response of mice exposed to experimental acid - induced ali and treated with the selective cox-2 inhibitor celecoxib. Ellagic acid and dexamethasone reduced the exacerbation of ali inflammation induced by cox-2 inhibition. Both treatments reduced the recruitment of total cells , neutrophils , macrophages , and lymphocytes into the balf. The results suggested a protective effect of ellagic acid on the airway.  ellagic acid reduced several inflammatory parameters, including the vascular permeability alterations and the neutrophil recruitment to the balf and the lung. In airway inflammation of ali , the neutrophicils are the first cells to be recruited and are the predominant cause of tissue damage. A persisting neutrophilia is associated with a poor outcome of ali. veolar - capillary barrier , as well as epithelial damage , which results in the impairment of arterial oxygenation. over the past several years , no therapeutic agents have demonstrated a clear benefit during ali treatment. utilising secondary metabolites from medicinal plants that can control leukocyte recruitment , such as neutrophils , could be a strategy to reduce the lung damage during ali. ated ( sulphate ester , glucuronide , and glutathione conjugates ) or metabolized by bacteria in the gut to produce urolithins ( a and b ) These metabolites could be also responsible for the biological activity of ellagic acid such as anti - inflammatory activity. While these metabolites do not accumulate in organ tissues , the freeEllagic acid irreversibly binds to macromolecules ( proteins and dna )   and consequently might accumulate in the epithelial cells and others cells. Ellagic acid did not reduce nf-b activation during the peak of inflammation in acid - initiated ali. These findings suggest that the effect of ellagic acid on acid - induced ali was nf -b and ap-1 independent. Ellagic acid could improve the outcome , as well as the prognosis , of ali in patients by modulating the cytokines involved in ali. L of ellagic acid did not produce toxic effects in humans over a 3-year period. The l. pacari extract did not show cytotoxicity in vitro or in vivo. Ellagic acid might be a future alternative treatment for the reduction of inflammation during ali and other inflammatory diseases with fewer adverse effects than corticosteroids.',\n",
       " 'yttria - stabilized zro2 ( ysz) is already commonly used as a solid oxide fuel cell ( sofc ) electrolyte and anode component. Despite its technological importance ,  \\xa0ysz itself is a very complex material , adopting different crystal structures ( monoclinic , tetragonal , and cubic ) with varying y content below 20 mol %. Studies on ysz by ft - ir spectroscopy are almost  exclusively focused on investigating its crystal structure. The aim of our studies therefore is to provide a first comparison of the surface chemical properties of technically used ysZ with 8 mol % yttria content and its separated chemical constituents y2o3 and zro2. All samples were pretreated by calcination at 1173 k in air and subsequently checked by xrd for structural changes. The surface area after pretreatment was determined by nitrogen adsorption at 77 k according to the bet method. ft - ir spectra were recorded in transmission mode on a perkin - elmer ft and ir system 2000. Infrared spectra of static adsorption of co2 on pure  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 y2o3 at room temperature at pressures up to  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 10 mbar. Adsorption leads to formation of a number of distinct ( bi)carbonate and hydroxyl species. At a pressure of 3  10 m bar almost no formation of carbonates is observed. The main process associated with chemisorption of a co2 molecule on y2o3 is the insertion into  a basic surface hydroxyl group leading to the formation of bicarbonates. Figure 4 illustrates the thermal evolution of the ( bi)carbonate  species on y 2o3 in 10 mbar co2 up to 873 k under static conditions. infrared spectra have been taken in 100 k steps. The binding strength of the different kinds of co2 adsorbates with increasing temperature on y2o3 increases with temperature. At 873 k only signals of polydentate carbonate species are present. This effect was observed in particular under flowing co2 conditions, which under the chosen experimental conditions are less dry.  infrared spectra collected during heating ysz-8 in dry flowing co2 ( co2 flow = 0.4 ml / s ) up to 873 k together with the assignment of the observed ( bi- ) carbonates at room temperature. Broad features located at 1305 cm can be ascribed to the s mode of the bridged carbonate and the other main adsorbate signals at 1646 , 1429 , and 1225 cm represent the corresponding bidentate carbonate. Only very weak adsorption signals of co2 were observed after annealing in co2 pressures up to  12 mbar. Spectra taken on pure monoclinic zro2 show very weak signals. This is essentially due to the strong dehydroxylation treatment. This corroborates the assumption that hydroxyl groups are of crucial importance for the chemisorption of co2. As a result, zro 2 remains almost unreactive for co2 adsorption. On pure y2o3, the monodentate bicarbonate must be more strongly bound than the bidentate carbonate. On ysz-8, the relative fraction of bidentates and bridged carbonate species is higher. The spectra of pokrovski et al. show a higher fraction of bridged species on tetragonal zro2. The adsorption of ysz-8 is basically dominated by the hydroxylated y centers. At room temperature no adsorptive or reaction takes place, but during heating co2 formation starts at 373 k. At 773 k the polydentate carbonate is the main species of co2. Figure 9 shows ysz-8 heated in flowing co ( co flow = 0.2 ml s ) up to 873 k. infrared spectra have been taken in 100 k steps. Typical formate peaks at 2875 cm for the (ch ) mode and 1581 , 1384 , and 1357 cm representing the as(oco ) mode of the formate. Infrared spectra collected upon heating zro2 following static adsorption of 248 mbar co up to 873 k. infrared spectra have  been taken in 100 k steps to ensure full correlation with the co2 measurements. pure dehydroxylated zro 2 did not show significant signals attributable to surface adsorbates in static co ( figure 10) The yttrium amount in ysz-8 is important for chemisorption reactivity because in contrast to pure zro2 the surface of the mixed oxide can be easily reactivated after dehydroxylation. y2o3 and ysZ-8 show much higher reactivity toward both co2 and co adsorption than zro 2. The formation of formate intermediates is observed on all oxides but the absence of a significant amount of hydroxyl groups on zro1 leads to very weak signals. Water  gas shift reaction , intermediates of ch4 reforming )  on ysz - based cermet anodes may be mechanistically / kinetically influenced by the basic character and by the pronounced reversibility and degree  of hydroxylation of the y - centers in ysZ-8.',\n",

Special nursing care could be visited only once in a month indicating a serious care deficit. Others were visited once in 2 or 3 months according to the severity of their illnesses. One important reason could be a lack of workforce and dedicated transport for such a purpose. providing better services resulted in huge escalation of cost per home visit, as in the case of the ngo. The role of lsgis appears mainly restricted to funding  its allocation and spending, rather than devising an organizational and care logistics geared toward improved service quality. There were open conflicts between lsgi members and health workers regarding fund utilization and membership. The initial aim of the government to utilize the experience of cbos / ngos and actively work with them seems to have failed. Palliative care program in two lsgis is still short of a public health approach, and major guidelines of the palliative policy seem to have been given a miss. It also lacks the flavor of a community - owned program with a committed organizational structure, dedicated staff and delivery mechanism.

       " 'in some important ways , mh both replaced and replicated the social and economic networks that families, at their most basic level , constitute. nineteenth - century missionaries were slow to make converts of zulu - speakers. Some of the earliest to come to the mission  stations and undergo baptism were those who had fled from or been rejected by their families. Among the most prominent of these families by the 1940s were those of goba , ngcobo and luthuli. beatrice gcabashe ( ne msimang ) was the first african registered nurse in natal to obtain joint general nursing and midwifery registration. her son was later an intern at mh in the 1950s. White guests were barred from attending the wedding of hilda and thulani gcabashe at groutville. The notion of the mccord family was hierarchically constructed and in practice recognised as equals only fellow missionaries and senior staff matrons. The largely female , black nursing ,  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0 cleaning and other staff were merely subordinates , or children. The relationship between james and margaret mccord and edna mzoneli is suggestive of how the close association between these self - identified parental figures could be influential in the moulding of a sense of self. edna who had a cast in one eye was regarded by both missionaries and her  own father as weak and  stupid , and she was subject to bouts of hysteria . demented , margaret physically shook her and  instructed her to go to her room and not to return until she could behave  as a nurse. Mccord nursing staff were largely from inanda seminary. Staff selection was largely of medical and surgical staff who may have been of faiths other than christian. discipline applied both to an internal disposition and to outward manifestations of control. Both mccord s memoir and the oral testimony of long - service mh nurses record a strong sense of pride in being a mh nurse. Martha the midwife was expelled from her course only three weeks before its end because she was staying over with a boyfriend and was already pregnant. taylor explained that he had not done this lightly and , he said, would have preferred  to work something out. But that he and the matron felt they had little alternative since martha expressed no contrition or signs of change of heart. In the early years of the twentieth century, zulu - speaking evangelists worked with the mccords to persuade sometimes dubious patients of the value of biomedicine. The practices of preaching and praying continued even after the hospital had been established and expanded. In turn, this christian ethos did much to help build the unifying going against the growing trend towards secularisation. Senior staff at mh infused christianity into the hospital s daily routines. The medical superintendents , matrons and nurse tutors devoted much effort to nurturing and sustaining within their nurse trainees a deep sense of christian devotion. Every morning before classes commenced, prayers were held. christian messages , themes and stories were published in isibuko newsletters. Staff and nurses could explore their own spiritual and individual identities, even to raise questions about their faith or public or private conduct. One nurse asked the following existential, political and spiritual questions out loud during quiet time in may 1960: why not an insect  a flower  a tree? In letters between taylor and dr  paul keen of  the  non - european hospital in johannesburg written in 1961, harrowing details of drug addictions, overdoses , alcoholism and suicides amongst black doctors are itemised. Not all patients in particular succumbed to the proselytising ; and some nurse trainees objected to the  prison - like discipline and regimented structures within the hospital. The mccord family created a family atmosphere at mh. The role of mother was often fulfilled by their marital counterparts. These included organising hospital social functions, such as annual christmas lunches. These events were hosted in the homes or gardens of the incumbent medical superintendent and his wife. The hospital has long had a vibrant culture of levity. This dates back at least to both the mccords and taylors own sometimes jocular and sometimes wry sense of fun. The humour displayed in these mh skits on hospital life may be part of what mikhail  bakhtin has dubbed the carnivalesque release of tensions. Hospital in Durban, South Africa, opened in september 1952 on mnini tribal trust land. In defiance of racially separatist apartheid laws, doctors and nurses could relax and spend time away together. Staff members would spend weekends there to mark special occasions, such as the end of year nurse trainee results. Mh was a mission hospital with high patient volumes and long hours of work. The middle decades of the twentieth century were turbulent ones for mh. It had to weather the storm of political change that accompanied the election of a more conservative government. Mh faced very real threats of closure under the notorious group areas act for being wrongly sited in a white area. White staff and their families were made targets of racial abuse and even assault because they or someone they knew worked at this kaffir hospital. Black staff not living on the premises had no option but to live in segregated townships far from their work place and in inferior accommodation. In 1950 11% of its in - patients were made up of indians and coloureds : and this had increased dramatically to about 40% by 1975. By the 1960s, mh managers worked hard to achieve parity in the doctors and nurses salary scales across racial lines. In 1959, taylor persuaded the mh board to vote in favour of paying all of its first year medical interns on the natal provincial administration ( npa)-determined white salary scale. In 1967, the hospital board accepted the middle figure salary scale that had been stipulated by the npa for indian medical employees. Mccords was one of the first hospitals in the country to open up positions for black nurses and doctors. By the 1960s, there were more black nurses in the hospital than there were white nurses. Many of the nurses had been brought up in different parts of the country. By the 1960s, increasingly the hospital s white managers knew that they were being watched by security police , and threatened on occasion with closure. The development of interracial friendships led to deep personal levels of support for individuals going through difficult times in their private lives. The fact that staff strikes , industrial disputes or serious disciplinary measures were not a serious feature of the mh landscape until the 1970s says much about the strength of bonds forged by this sense of family. Dr taylor wrote weekly letters to all his biological children by writing to them as adults. These letters were written whenever he could carve a moment  to write in his busy schedule. The letters kept his family informed of the people and goings - on at mh, including people they had met as children. aylor wrote in an editorial entitled  greetings to the mccord family everywhere about the strong bonds members of  the mCCord family shared. The taylors shared the news of their family s lives with many people whose lives  they regarded as intertwined with their own. Many nurses living hundreds if not thousands of kilometres away from mh greatly appreciated this written umbilicus. The mccords and taylors actively crafted an extensive network of personal and professional friends for mh. Some of these mccord friends also provided considerable material support for the hospital. Having an extended family of loyal supporters played an enormous role in enabling the hospital to survive and expand in difficult times. Hospitals in south africa reflected and reinforced the wider social orders of which they were a part. This world could be deeply conservative and reinforcing of patriarchal and patronising behaviours and attitudes. But mccord hospital also offered many a space and an identity where they could feel part of a larger while mh has certainly not been without its internal inequalities. Mccord hospital in South Africa is one of the largest hospitals in the country. The impending state takeover of mh is expected to change the way the hospital is run. A critical history of the ways in which individuals, hospitals , faith and families intersect may be of value for the future of hospitals in africa.',\n",

       " \"myofascial pain syndrome ( mps ) is a common dysfunction affecting up to 85% of general population. It affects the muscles of mastication and neck and covers sensory, motor, and autonomic symptoms. mps is characterized by the presence of tender zones called trigger points. although medications are frequently advised , it is necessary to think of alternative therapies such as meditation. meditation has substantial effect on pain perception, sleep patterns, psychological morbidity , and sympathetic nervous system. meditation alleviates all known precipitating factors of mps. mindfulness - based treatment programs were applied in the management of chronic pain, anxiety , emotional disorders, and mainly fibromyalgia ( fm ) Meditation can help alleviate pain through myofascial pain through meditation. i have attempted to apply some of these findings to identify potential mechanisms involved in the alleviation of fm symptoms. mindfulness - based stress reduction reduced majority of fM symptoms including sleep quality and fatigue. home practice reduced general symptom severity.  meditation increases cerebral blood flow in the anterior cingulate cortex ( acc ) , pfc , insula ( region involved in emotion regulation ) regular mindfulness practice causes a greater activation of acc and less utilization of pfc. meditation also reduces pain by activating the orbitofrontal cortex ( brodmann area 10 , 11 , and 47 ) Zen meditation found increased alpha and theta activity in the frontal cortex, generally related to relaxation. sleep deprivation can be a contributory for pain syndromes in general and in myofascial pain. insomnia was the most frequent aggravating factor in 2500 fm patients.  mindfulness meditation has promising potential as a nonpharmacologic treatment of chronic pain for patients with mps. The common benefits with mindfulness meditation include pain reduction, acceptance of pain , better sleep , and enhanced well - being. meditation is a neuromodulatory practice capable of neutralizing the effect of perpetuating factors on pain. The insula is a brain region that controls the autonomic nervous system. It receives inputs from the posterior part of the thalamus specialized to convey pain information. Thalamic communication with higher centers is deactivated by mindfulness meditation and the pain signals simply fade away. mindfulness meditation also reduces pain by activating the orbitofrontal cortex. Sleep deprivation is a contributory for pain syndromes in general and in myofascial pain. sleep deprivation impairs descending pain - inhibition pathways that are important in coping with pain. Stress and anxiety are the body 's response to perceived physical and mental stress. mindfulness meditation has promising potential as a nonph. Meditation is a neuromodulatory practice capable of neutralizing the effect of perpetuating factors on myofascial pain syndrome. autonomic nervous system is pivotal in muscle contractility , genesis of muscle spasm , and mps. common benefits with mindfulness meditation include pain reduction, acceptance of pain , better sleep , and enhanced well - being.  meditation reduces oxidative stress, can improve mitochondrial performance, which is critical for effective calcium transport during muscle contraction. chronic pain syndromes such as fm are also associated with chromosomal aberrations such as telomere shortening. Patients with shorter telomeres were more sensitive to evoked pain and had less gray matter in the primary somatosensory cortex , the area associated with pain processing.  meditation increases the activity in the same regions in the brain that participate in mps. meditation reduces the experience of pain by uncoupling sensory dimension ( pain sensation ) from the intrinsic alarm response ( emotional reaction to pain ) The brain is highly plastic and responds promptly to changes in the degree of mindfulness.\",\n",
       " 'Cholera is characterized by profuse watery diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, circulatory collapse , and shock.

       " 'Evidence - based medicine requires integrating individual clinician expertise with the best available external clinical evidence and patient choice. individualized clinical guidelines take into account individual risk factors and expected benefit from treatment. Little is known about the use of individualized guidelines in routine clinical practice. demonstrating the potential benefits of individualize guidelines for a specific clinical problem is one challenge that must be met.  indigo predicts individualized 5-year risk of heart attack or stroke under three scenarios. The score is a weighted combination of the decreased risk of adverse outcomes. A simulation found that individualized guidelines could lead to improved quality of care and lower costs for patients with hypertension , compared to traditional guidelines.  patients were considered eligible for indigo use if they had a scheduled primary care visit and their indigo total benefit score was in the top third of the kphi population. pcp and patients subsequently used indigo in 510-min shared decision - making sessions. We compared patients using indigo at the pilot clinics with those receiving usual care at other clinics. The primary outcome measures were prescribing and dispensing medications that have been shown to reduce the risk of heart attack or stroke. Indigo individualized guidelines were implemented by automated daily extraction of relevant clinical information for all kphi adult members. Data were collected during focus groups and a post - project email survey ( physicians ) and through a pre - post mail survey ( patients ) We used difference - in - differences methods to evaluate changes in the secondary outcome measures between the intervention group and matched controls. We compared patients using indigo at the pilot clinics with those receiving usual care at other clinics. We identified the matched comparison cohort using nearest - neighbor propensity score matching with replacement. We estimated a logistic regression model with indigo use as the dependent variable and six matching variables. The primary outcome measures were prescribing and dispensing medications that have been shown to reduce the risk of heart attack or stroke. tics , calcium antagonists , -blockers , and ace inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers ( arb ) . because indigo often recommends multiple medications , we grouped them by likely indication to simplify the analysis and gauge any general effect on prescribing and dispensing rates. statins and other lipid - lowering medications were grouped , and we refer to them collectively as statins. medications and medication combinations intended primarily for hypertension control. igo identifications ranged from 0% for lifestyle interventions to 89% for adding a -blocker. patients who used indigo and had statins recommended received significantly more new statin prescriptions than did usual care patients. patients using indigo with new prescriptions for statins had a non - significant increase in the percentage that picked up at least one dispensing. ine ( 5  mg ) , as well as any of these in combination with atenolol or lisinopril. ldl and blood pressure values exclude 121 patients who were not reassessed between indigo use and the end of follow - up. 90% of physicians reported they lacked time to use indigo with all patients who could benefit.  patients using indigo were not significantly more likely to be prescribed an antihypertensive medication , but those with new prescriptions were 30% more Likely to pick up at least one dispensing. no between - group differences were found in systolic blood pressure , ldl cholesterol , or bmi. the predicted 5-year risk of heart attack or stroke decreased significantly more among patients usingIndigo. Indigo individualized clinical guidelines were successfully implemented in primary care and were associated with increased prescribing and dispensing of some cardioprotective medications. Our limited - scale project demonstrates the feasibility of implementing individualized guidelines in clinical care and suggests benefits. An appropriate controlled trial would be needed to establish the clinical benefits of treatment guided by indigo.',\n",
       " 'adolescence is a critical period for normal growth and development where there is a gradual transition between childhood and adulthood. sleep , in a complex association with many other processes , plays an important role in adolescents as dramatic maturational changes in sleep and its neurobiological regulation occur in this period. studies done by carskadon shows that older adolescents may actually have a physiological need for more sleep than preadolescents. sleep deprivation is sleep less than the average and about 9 h of sleep per night for adolescents.  sleep hygiene refers to a variety of different practices that are necessary to have normal nighttime sleep and full daytime alertness. poor sleep hygiene practices impair cognitive and behavioral ability in children. sleep - deprived habits established in adolescence can often lead to problems during subsequent college years. monitoring all adolescents and college - aged students for sleep insufficiency is imperative to improve academic and emotional well - being. Information was collected using a structured questionnaire. out of 145 questionnaires distributed , the questionnaire consisted of two parts. The first part contained 28 items and included three questions related to demographic profile such as age, sex, and grade level. The second part assessed the sleep hygiene behaviors through a 13-item questionnaire developed by mastin and corwyn in 2006. 90 ( 64%) of 140 adolescents were females and 50 ( 36%) were males. Majority ( 66%) were middle adolescents in the age group of 1517 years. The time of going to bed and getting up from sleep for adolescents during a typical school day was 10.9 h and 5.5 h, respectively. The sleep duration on a weekend was 8.4  2.7 h, i.e. 1.8 h more than during a school day. Sleep duration of adolescents on higher grade levels was less when compared to sleep duration of adolescent on lower grade levels. majority of adolescents ( 52.1% ) reported that they take daytime naps during school days. 60.7% adolescents parents influenced their time of getting up from bed on school days . during weekends, only 44 adolescents ( 31.4%) reported that their parents influenced. their rise times. relationship between parental monitoring and sleep duration was not statistically significant. Among the total of 140 adolescents, 90 ( 64%) were females and 50 ( 36%) were males. Majority ( 66%) were middle adolescents in the age group of 1517 years and belonged to upper grade levels. The time of going to bed and getting up from sleep for adolescents during a typical school day was 10.9 h and 5.5 h, respectively. Average sleep duration during school days was 06.5  1.0 h, much less than the average recommended sleep for this age group. Sleep duration of adolescents on higher grade levels were less when compared to sleep duration of adolescent on lower grade levels. sleep duration by gender showed that male adolescents obtained slightly longer sleep duration on school days than female adolescents ( 6.7 h vs. 6.5 h , respectively ) . on weekends , female adolescents slept few minutes longer than male adolescents ( 8.4 h vs 8.3 h ,respectively ) However, there is no statistically significant difference in sleep duration between male and female adolescents. Sleep duration of adolescents on higher grade levels was less when compared to sleep duration of adolescent on lower grade levels. majority of adolescents ( 52.1% ) reported that they take daytime naps during school days. 60.7% adolescents parents influenced their time of getting up from bed on school days . during weekends, only 44 adolescents ( 31.4%) reported that their parents influence their rise times. male adolescents obtained slightly higher sleep hygiene scores than female adolescents. Study investigated the sleep - wake patterns of indian adolescents studying in bahrain on school days and weekends. sleep duration and associations between sleep duration, sleep hygiene behaviors and parental monitoring were investigated. The adolescents in this study obtained less than the average recommended 9 h of sleep for their age group. Adolescents on higher grade slept less compared to adolescents on lower grade levels in india. Majority of adolescents in bahrain took a daytime nap regularly on school days lasting 12 h as a method to compensate for their lost sleep similar to 60% of students in greece. majority of the adolescents in this study reported that parental monitoring was absent during school days and weekends. The study investigated adolescents sleep patterns and its association with sleep hygiene behaviors and parental monitoring. The results suggest that there is a high prevalence of insufficient sleep and irregular bedtime schedule in adolescent students in bahrain. The biological, behavioral and social and environmental factors have to be addressed to develop regular sleep schedules and to entrain the circadian system. The study looked at the pubertal changes associated with sleep to further understand the sleep problems in adolescents. The study also looked at sleep patterns in children as well as adults. The results were published in the Journal of Adolescent Sleep Research and Education. The report was published on November 14, 2013.',\n",
       " ' intratympanic steroids ( itss) may treat issnhl more effectively than oral steroids. We reviewed our experience with its, which included an analysis of the timing of post - treatment audiograms. We sought to determine if there is a different recovery rate depending on when audiograms are performed after completing its treatment. During the study period, 172 series of injections were performed in 151 patients with 60 patients diagnosed with issnhl. of those 60, 13 were excluded due to insufficient data , and 7 were excluded because they did not have at least a 30  db hearing loss in 3 contiguous frequencies. The average number of days from the onset of hearing loss to the initiation of its was 22.7. Patients with serviceable hearing increased from 7/40 ( 17.5% ) prior to its to 15/40 after its. The average number of days that an audiogram was performed was 33.2 days after the first steroid injection. Patients with vertigo were 6.2 times more likely to improve than patients who did not experience vertigo. Our data are similar to other reviews of its with regard to demographics of issnhl and response rate to its. Most other reviews report post - treatment audiograms as taking place during a certain range of weeks or months after treatment has concluded. A few studies have reported the use of serial audiograms during or immediately after the completion of treatment with its. The data suggest an increased probability of improvement in all 3 groups when comparing audiograms from immediately after treatment with those performed at least 4 weeks after the initial injection. The timing of the audiogram will determine the observed response. A series of audiograms should be administered during and after treatment to document the timing of treatment response. This will identify early versus late responders and may provide important clues to the etiology of hearing loss. The shorter interval between hearing loss and the start of treatment in patients with vertigo versus those who did not ( 32 days to treatment ) best explains this result. Our study highlights an area of its that is still yet to be defined : the timing of post - treatment audiograms in assessing treatment response.',\n",
       " \" ageism has been defined as  a systematic stereotyping of discrimination against people because they are old. ageism is perpetuated by the portrayal of older people as frail, ill , suffering mental deterioration , poor and dependent. budget constraints in the uk and ireland which currently pitch health services against social services over costs for supportive care packages negate against timely discharge from hospital. Underfunding and low priority given to the development of services for older people is considered to profoundly influence how healthcare workers think about working with older people. The republic of ireland has a population of 4,203,200 , and the proportion of its population aged 65 years and above is 11.0%. The study was a survey of attitudes of healthcare workers towards older people. attitudes were measured using the kogan 's attitudes towards olderPeople scale [ kop ] developed by kogan in 1961. kop is a 34-item likert type scale with 17 matched positive and negative statements. The reliability of kop has since been confirmed by other researchers. The minimum score possible was 34 , and the maximum score possible is 204. The participants were employed within health service executive sectors as ward managers, registered nurses, public health nurses, healthcare assistants , and student nurses. The main ethical implications of this research were informed consent , confidentiality , and anonymity of participants. A total of 303 questionnaires were distributed to health care workers. 190 returned the completed questionnaires. The study had an overall response rate of 62.2% , which is comparable to similar studies of 57%   and 69% Three questionnaires with five or more missing item data out of a total of 34 were withdrawn from the study. An independent sample t - test was used to compare kop mean attitude scores between males and females. Participants were then categorised in 5 groups according to their job titles. The variation of intensity of attitudes was illustrated by dividing the potential range of scores into six equal categories. This showed that health care workers held positive attitudes towards older people. Our study did not detect significant differences in attitude scores measured by kop across gender, job title, length of service in current role , and work place setting. In contrast , our study did detect a significant difference in scores for university graduates , when compared to those who had not attained a university qualification. Staff who attained a university qualification had significantly higher mean kop scores than those health care workers who had not attained university qualifications. Our findings suggest that public health nurses hold more positive attitudes towards older people than registered nurses, nursing assistants , and students. Public health nurses are community based and embedded in the community. This may partly explain why public health workers hold the most positive attitudes. The study was undertaken in a rural county in the republic of ireland with a generally stable nursing workforce. It is possible that healthcare workers are regularly caring for older people they have come to know as individuals. Budget constraints in the uk and ireland currently pitch health services against social services and stall development of supportive care packages.  neglect , and substandard care receiving media coverage are also in danger of undermining those healthcare workers who are attempting to provide quality care in challenging times. Despite this context , it is reassuring that in our study , nurses and nursing assistants hold positive attitudes towards older people. It is also reassuring that nurse and nursing assistant are more likely to be positive about older people than younger people.\",\n",
       " 'cardiac arrhythmias in patients with epilepsy represent an important area of clinical interest. We present two cases of potentially lethal asystole associated with seizures of right, rather than the expected left, hemispheric onset. A 37 -year - old man with nonlesional epilepsy was observed to have a seizure characterized by a feeling of dj vu followed by altered awareness during which bilateral tonic extension of the upper extremities occurred. A 60 -year-old woman presented with two seizures characterized by staring and altered awareness followed by left arm and leg shaking. A 60 -year -old woman presented with two seizures characterized by staring and altered awareness followed by left arm and leg shaking for 30  s. simultaneously. Her ekg revealed an initial bradycardia followed by asystole lasting 15  s and she required cardiopulmonary resuscitation for both episodes. brain mri revealed an enhancing lesion in the right hemisphere involving the frontal and temporal lobes, insula, thalamus, hypothalamus, and pons. The mechanisms underlying ictal cardiac arrhythmias remain elusive. genomic biomarkers are in development aiming to reliably detect channelopathies which may subserve dual roles in epileptogenesis as well as cardiorespiratory pathophysiology. There are currently no clinical guidelines pertaining to the type of epilepsy syndrome.',\n",
       " 'in resource - limited countries, the prevalence of chronic hepatitis b virus ( hbv ) and hepatitis c virus (hcv ) infection is often high. Liver failure is becoming the major cause of death in patients with hepatitis co - infection. While access to haart has markedly increased, overall haart coverage remains as low as 36%. The effect of viral hepatitis co - infection on hiv progression and all - cause mortality before initiating haart remains uncertain. Most studies conducted in the late 1990s and early 2000s did not include hiv viral load in their analysis. The main transmission mode of hiv in participants was homosexual intercourse or injecting drug use ( idu ) The remaining freeze - stored plasma samples from our previous study were retrospectively tested for hepatitis b surface antigen ( hbsag ) and antibody to hepatitis c virus ( anti - hcv) The survival status for each patient was ascertained by hospital records, death certificates, mailing letters and contacting families or relatives.  median age at enrolment was 33 years ( 95% ci 2937 ) , and 218% had received mono or dual art.

The curves for hiv / hbv and hcv / hiv co - infection converge at about 500 days. The likelihood ratio test for interaction by time band with a cut - point at 500 days revealed a p value of 02. The influence of hepatitis co - infection on survival analysed by the cox proportional hazard model is presented in table 3a. factors associated with death were male gender, previous art treatment, clinical symptom at enrolment, baseline cd4 cell count, baseline viral load and existence of anti - hbcab.

Primary causes of death were unknown for nine out of 56 hiv / hepatitis co - infected patients. Majority of deaths ( 46/56 , 821% ) were attributed to aids - related diseases. No patients were diagnosed with liver failure before death except for one patient who was hospitalized for 6 days due to newly diagnosed cirrhosis with portal hypertension. Hepatitis co - infection accelerates the natural course of hiv infection itself. The majority of chronic hbv or hcv co - infected hiv patients died from aids - defined illness rather than liver failure. It is striking that hbV co- infected patients without anti - hbcab had the poorest prognosis.  clinical implication of the absence of anti - hbcab during chronic hbv infection remain largely unknown except that it is not linked to severe hepatic disease course. adequate treatment for chronic hepatitis is not available in resource - limited countries. screening for hepatitis co - infection at the same time as hiv diagnosis should be urgently implemented.',\n",
       " 'A total of 183 patients received stsg for treatment of foot and leg ulcers between 2002 and 2010. Patients were excluded from the study if they did not have a history of diabetes mellitus and/or less than 6 months follow up from the time of the application of the stsg. The graft site was dressed with povidone - iodine soaked non - adherent gauze and sterile dry dressing. The graft was then meshed in a 1:1.5 ratio and applied directly to the wound bed taking care to smooth any wrinkles and allow maximum apposition of the graft with the wound surface. The patients were followed clinically at two weeks post - operatively and then on a weekly basis for dressing changes and to assess healing progress. The vast majority of patients ( 97/107 , or 90.1% ) were completely healed by 6 weeks post - operatively while only four patients ( 3.7% ) required 10 weeks. The number of weeks to complete wound healing ranged from 3 to 16 weeks with an average healing time of 5.1 weeks. One patient had a history of charcot neuroarthropathy and received a stsg. The patients who had 100% graft take had a shorter healing time than those with graft take of less than 95% ( p<0.001 ) Patients with complications had a mean time to complete wound healing of 12.0 weeks compared to 4.9 weeks for patients without complications. Only three of the patients had a complication with the original stsg. The mean healing time for the meshed group was 19.84 and 20.36 days for the non - meshedGroup. Most stsg studies in non - diabetic studies report healing times between 2 and 4 weeks. The specific preoperative risk factors showed no effect on healing time. Age , wound size , and wound location did not seem to have a significant effect. Patients with less than 95% graft take had an average healing time of more than 3 weeks slower than those with a graft take of 100% ( 7.9 weeks vs 4.8 weeks ) skin graft healing and incorporation is a complex biological process involving various stages of adherence , nourishment , revascularization , and final incorporation. Any mechanical or biological disruption of this process puts the graft at risk for failure or prolonged healing. The study demonstrated a very low complication rate of 2.8% and an average wound healing time of 5.1 weeks for all patients. None of the patient characteristics or comorbidities in this study appeared to affect stsg healing times. We conclude that autologous stsg are a safe and reliable alternative for the treatment of non - healing diabetic foot and leg wounds.',\n",
       " 'Topical glaucoma medications are usually solutions / suspensions that are dispensed in a low - density polyethylene bottle. There is a relative paucity of data on patient feedback observations on the physical characteristics of topical glau coma medication. This information is pertinent for improving the bottle features and may be important for understanding patient compliance. For example, bottle tip diameter, bottle label , and instructions ; cap color coding and readability of the label may all influence how a patient uses the medication. Antiglaucoma brands versus local brands ( ksa) based on patient perspectives. Data were collected on drug volume in the bottle, drop volume, bottle  squeezability,  bottle tip diameter, bottle label and instructions, cap color coding , and clarity of the drug label. The American academy of ophthalmology ( aao) recommended that a uniform color coding system is established for the caps and labels of all topical ocular medications. Patients were given a set of three international brands ( cosopt , trusopt , and alphagan ) and three local equivalent generic brands ( xolamol , xola , and brimo ) The data were analyzed using the statistical package for social studies version 16 ( ibm corporation ) Medication volume and drop volume measurement were performed using a densitometric method that has been previously described. Patients were given a set of three international brands ( cosopt , trusopt , and alphagan ) and three local brands ( latanocom, xolamol and xalacom) Patients were also asked for feedback on bottle characteristics including ease in squeezing the bottle, ability to open the cap smoothly and ease in expressing a single drop from the bottle. The data were analyzed using the statistical package for social studies version 16 ( ibm corporation, armonk , new york , usa ) The physical characteristics of topical glaucoma medication were evaluated using five international brands and five brands manufactured in saudi arabia. The number of drops available in each bottle in local and international brands of medications is presented in figure 1. The study included two components : a laboratory - based evaluation of the volume and bottle tip variability and patient feedback on the physical characteristics of the bottle. The overall score regarding ease of use in using an international and local brand of glaucoma medication was not significantly different between the two groups. Bottles with greater volumes than stated on the label have been previously described for international brands. Data are unavailable in the literature for local brands from ksa. It is unclear if overfilling medication bottles is intentional to account for medication spillage during instillation or it is due to variability in the manufacturing process. The ability to express drops from the bottle was related to the compressibility ( \" squeezability \" ) of the bottle rather than the tip diameter. Only two of the international brands with a single medication in the container were consistent with aao recommendations for cap color. The use of different colored caps may have variable benefit in patients with advanced glaucoma as the disease can alter contrast sensitivity and color perception. This is the first study of local generic equivalents of topical glaucoma medications from saudi arabia. International brands consistently contained a larger number of drops per bottle than stated on the bottle. Two of the local brands contained less drops than stated. The angle at which the bottle is held may alter the effective dosage.',\n",
       " 'Neutrophil recruitment is complex and regulated by a variety of molecules and signalling cascades triggered by the cross - talk between neutrophils and endothelium. neutrophil rolling is mediated by selectins and adhesion by 2 integrins, while emigration is regulated by the interactions between\\xa0integrins , pecam-1 , and junctional adhesion molecules and their respective ligands. Recently, an additional step of neutrophill recruitment termed intraluminal crawling was described. This is a process which is molecularly distinct from adhesion and enables neutrophiles to reach optimal emigration sites at endothelial junctions independently of hemodynamic forces.  p38 mapk was found to impair neutrophil chemotaxis and transendothelial migration induced by the chemokine kc. In this latter study, the number of emigrated neutrophils in each grid of defined distance from the observed venule was measured as a chemot axis parameter. However, the dynamic motile behavioural changes of chemotaxing neutrophiled were not measured. The role of p38 Mapk in these changes was not determined. Whether there is a role in intraluminal crawling has not been reported. sb203580 is a widely used selective inhibitor of the p38 and p38 isoforms. The mouse cremaster muscle preparation was used to study neutrophil behaviour in microcirculation and tissue. An agarose gel at 1  mm size containing the optimal concentration of cxc chemokine kc / cxcl1 ( 0.5  m ; peprotech , dollard des ormeaux , qc , canada ) was placed on the surface of the muscle. The number of rolling , adherent , and emigrated neutrophils during offline playback analysis was determined. Using imagej software, leukocyte intraluminal crawling , transmigration , and chemotaxis in cremasteric vasculature were analysed using the time - lapsed movie converted from the real - time video recording of the experiment as described previously. The same amount of dmso as in the sb203580-treated group was used in the control group without sb 203580 and was not found to affect any responses. Migration distance is the sum of the distance that the leukocyte moved from the start point after detachment from the venule to the end point of the migration in tissue at 60 or 90  min of kc treatment. Velocity of migration is migration distance in tissue divided by migration time ( m / min) Percentage of crawling leukocytes that transmigrated is the number of crawled and then transmigratedLeukocytes divided by the total number of crawling Leukocytes.  neutrophils were isolated using a percoll ( ge healthcare , uppsala , sweden ) gradient ( 72% , 64% , and 52% ) centrifugation at 1060  g for 30  min as described previously. neutrophil suspension ( 10/ml) was washed in ice - cold pbs containing 0.5% bsa and stained with a fluorescent anti - mac-1 antibody ( anti - mouse cd11b fitc ; clone m1/70 ; ebioscience ) or fluorescent anti- lfa-1 antibodies. cells were stimulated with kc ( 5  nm for 10  min ) to upregulate Mac-1 or lfa -1 expression. The effect of sb203580 on the early neutrophil recruitment process of rolling was analyzed using intravital microscopy. The number of emigrated neutrophils was not reduced until 60  min kc treatment in sb 203580-treated cremaster muscles as compared to the saline - superfusion control. The same treatment reduced leukocytes adhesion by 32% and leukocyte emigration by 50% at 60 Min after kc. Next , we assessed the effects of pharmacologically inhibiting p38 mapk on neutrophil intraluminal crawling and transendothelial migration. Treatment with sb203580 did not significantly modify the total distance traversed by crawling neutrophils and the time taken. The treatment of neutrophils with kc in vitro did not change the expression level of lfa-1. sb203580 ( 10  m ) virtually abrogated kc - triggered upregulation of mac-1 expression. The reduced intraluminal crawling and transendothelial migration upon sb 203580 treatment would subsequently result in a decrease in the migration and chemotaxis. In this study, we demonstrate the effects of the p38 mapk inhibitor sb203580 on the modulation of different steps of neutrophil recruitment. We found that in vivo treatment with sb 203580 does not appreciably alter the parameters of Neutrophil intraluminal crawling but significantly modifies cellular functions during transendothelial migration and chemotaxis in tissue. This is the first study that systematically analysed the effect of the inhibitor on each step of the recruitment cascade in vivo. We observed a slight but significant reduction in the number of neutrophils adhering to the microvasculature. administration of sb203580 30  min following stimulation with kc dissipated the differences in adhesion and emigration. Although the efficiency of adherent leukocytes to crawl was slightly but significantly diminished in the presence of kc, the crawling directionality along the blood flow was not affected.  p38 mapk inhibitors sb239063 and skf86002 did not significantly alter mac-1 expression in vitro after stimulation with bacterial m1 protein. Although sb203580 significantly reduced the number of adherent neutrophils that proceeded to crawling , the various functional parameters of intraluminal crawling were not substantially altered. Taken together , our results suggest that the pharmacological p 38 mapk inhibitor sb 203580 affects neutrophil recruitment induced by the cxc chemokine kc.',\n",
       " 'Longus colli muscle dysfunction, including a lack of strength and endurance, has been demonstrated in patients with neck pain and whiplash injury. The cranio - cervical flexion test using bio - feedback pressure, magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) and electromyography ( us) has been used to measure muscle strength. The us measurement must be reliable and sensitive to provide accurate and relevant information. The purpose of this study was to investigate the intra- and inter - rater reliability of measurements of the csa and mt of the longus colla. Exclusion criteria were: 1) neuromuscular or musculoskeletal disorder; 2)  history of clavicle fracture, metal implant, or surgery; and 3) current neck pain. The subjects were placed in a neutral supine position with their knees and hips bent and  arms along the sides of the body. The inward pressure was set at 0  kg in contact with the skin during the application of the probe. The study protocol was explained simultaneously in the 1-hour training session prior to the testing. The examiners were blinded to their own previous findings as well as the us measurement results. The order of the measurements and examiners was randomized using a random number generator ( excel , microsoft corp . , calipers were used to measure the csa and mt in centimeters. The mean and standard deviation ( sd ) of each subject s characteristics and us image ( csa  and mt ) data were calculated. intra - class correlation coefficients ( icc 2 , 1 ) were used. to determine the intra- and inter - rater reliability of the cSA and mt measurements. The purpose of the present study was to determine intra- and inter - rater reliability of measurements of the csa and mt of the longus colli according to the inward pressure of the us probe ( 0.5 and 1  kg ) We believe that this study is the first to investigate these parameters in this manner. A consistent inward probe pressure is required to enhance the reliability of us measurements of the lateral abdominal muscle. Hands - free probe holders may be better able to prevent us measurement errors than hand - held probes. Our results are not widely generalizable because all of the participants were healthy students.',\n",

It is characterized by progressive weight loss, dyspnea, cough, diarrhea, and occasionally icterus. at the time of diagnosis of swine boop . but we can not exclude the possibility that pcv-2 may not be the sole factor.  pcv2 was associated with swine boop or intraluminal organization. mmps have been proposed to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, but the exact mechanisms are not well characterized. Future study is needed to elucidate the cytokine effects by which the pCV2 induces boop. Opn deficient transgenic mice demonstrated a reduction production of type i collagen and the level of activated mmp-2 and tgf-1. Although the expression of opn has been demonstrated in different human unusual interstitial pneumonia and murine bleomycin - induced pulmonary fibrosis , opn is still be elucidated in boop.',\n",
       " 'The optimum fluid resuscitation paradigm for patients with severe traumatic brain injury ( tbi) is not clear. The brain trauma foundation guidelines are silent on the issue of ffp : rbc ratios. Coagulopathy in severe tbi patients can lead to profound hematoma expansion resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. A better understanding of the optimal resuscitation paradigm for hypovolemic patients with severe tbi could potentially help our understanding of both of these pathophysiological processes. A major barrier in the study of resuscitation of tbi subjects with concomitant hypovolesmic shock is lack of a good animal model for the process. Tbi is superior because it is best at suppressing pathological expression of astrocytic gap junctions, thus decreasing edema progression. With both good animal data and results from prospective human studies in place , we should be in the position to significantly improve the care of severe tbi patients.',\n",

       " ' psoriatic arthritis ( psa) is a seronegative inflammatory disease of the joints, enthuses and periarticular connective tissue. psa has been included in the group of hla - b27-associated spondyloarthropathies as it shares many clinical features with them. It typically develops in persons aged 35 - 55 years with equal sex distribution.  psoriasis vulgaris [ figure 3 ] is the main form of Psoriasis associated with psa. It is often reported that a secondary affection of the joint may develop and vice versa. nail changes include onycholysis, hyperkeratosis, transverse ridging, nail pitting and oil drop discoloration.  between 6% and 42% of patients suffering from psoriasis will develop psa. Juvenile psa generally develops in children aged 9 - 10 with a female predominance. polymorphisms in the genes coded in the hla region on chromosome 6p have been shown to be associated with psa . moderate to severe psa and Psoriasis are linked to cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and increased mortality. Hla antigens may identify patients with a particular pattern of psa. The association of hla - c with psa was found to be due to association with early onset psoriasis. Non - hla genes within the mhc region have also been proposed to be associated with pSA. The tnf- gene is a key inflammatory cytokine in psoriasis and psa. associations have been reported between the tnF-308 polymorphism in the promoter region of the tNf- genes and pSA. have been shown with jewish , croatian , and british patients.  psa and psoriasis alone at three loci ; hla - c and il-23r were more strongly associated with psa than psorosis alone. The genetic screening test for psa provides information on the presence of a specific variation ( triple repeat polymorphism ) on the mica immune response gene located on chromosome 6p. Using this genetic test, a physician can conclude that a patient who tests positive for the mica - a9 variant has approximately 60% chance of developing psa. similarly, a patient that tests negative has approximately 70% chances of not developing pSA. genetic screening test for psa should be used as an adjunct to currently used diagnostic criteria to determine the need for medical therapy. There are several polymorphisms of the gene encoding the vdr which may alter its activity. This is the first prospective study to demonstrate that both clinical and genetic parameters may predict therapy response and remission duration in patients with psoriasis treated with nb - uvb. genetic tests today seem to represent a reliable investigation procedure which could rapidly and safely improve the diagnostic ability of the dermatologist. Patients with psoriatic disease can be treated in a variety of ways. This allows physicians to start in the earliest phase the correct treatment for the different subsets of patients. It can also drastically reduce the cost of the optimal treatment of psoriatics patients. Patients can also be treated with different drugs depending on their condition.',\n",
       " 'Suspected coronary artery disease ( cad) in patients with a concurrent malignancy greatly impacts prognosis and treatment decisions. Some cancer treatments may be cardiotoxic or lead to blood dyscrasias that could discourage the use of commonly prescribed cardiac medications. Noninvasive coronary anatomical imaging could therefore help with accurate treatment planning prior to using invasive strategies. All studies were performed using a 64-detector scanner ( lightspeed vct , general electric healthcare ( gehc ) , milwaukee , wi ) A calcium scoring scan was performed using 2.5  mm collimation and 25  cm display field of view. 150  ml of 320  mgi / ml contrast material ( iodixanol , visipaque 320 , gehC ) was administered at 5  ml / sec. Patients needing heart rate control were managed with oral calcium - channel blockers. About 45% of patients had hematological malignancy ( leukemia and lymphoma ) whereas the rest had a solid tumor. The most common indication for obtaining a ccta was lv dysfunction ( 41% of cases ) followed by chest pain and or dyspnea in 40% of the cases. 51.3% of patients had their cancer management altered based on ccta findings. In 10% of cases, exclusion of significant cad allowed for stem cell transplant evaluation to proceed. 4% of cancer surgery was performed without further cardiac testing. 2.5% of  patients subsequently started radiation therapy. Most patients with exposure to potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy who experience a decrease in lv function are considered for angiography. prior to the use of ccta , however , many could not undergo ica , and a conclusive diagnosis was often lacking. Significant cad in the setting of a cardiomyopathy could accurately be excluded , therefore confirming a suspicion of cic in a quarter of our patients.  cardiac computed tomographic angiography is an attractive imaging modality in cancer patients with suspected structural heart disease. It allows improved coordination of cancer and cardiac care. Long - term followup will be needed to show definitive improvement in overall outcomes. Whether ccta as a first step would compare favorably to other noninvasive modalities needs further study.',\n",
       " 'in conventional md simulations based on classical force fields the protonation state of each ionizable residue is fixed and ascribed externally. This is a considerable limitation when trying to study ph - dependent biological processes. A calculation of absolute proton affinity can be carried out only from a quantum mechanical ( qm ) treatment. A pure qm approach is impractical for biomolecular systems. Sudden jumps between discrete protonation states unavoidably lead to large differences in electrostatic energy and to a rejection of nearly all proposed change. The issue stems from the lack of overlap between the explicit solvent configurations of the protonated and unprotonated states. There is a need for a simulation methodology that is based entirely on an explicit solvent representation. An algorithm based on sampling a continuous does not scale very well for a bimolecular system with a large number n of ionizable sites. A different strategy to address the configurational overlap problem consists of considering an extended lagrangian with a continuous (t ) that is dynamically propagated to control the protonation state of the site. The constant - ph. simulation method is based on the enveloping distribution sampling ( eds ) method. eds is used to mix the energy surface of the protonated and unprotonated states for a small set of n preselected ionizable sites. systems with different values of the eds smoothing parameter are then connected via a hamiltonian replica - exchange to facilitate interconversion.  constant - ph algorithms that are applicable to only a small number of ionizable sites offer no advantage over direct fep calculations. The only approach that could be potentially scaled to a very large system is some type of hybrid md. The algorithm must be significantly enhanced to circumvent the configurational overlap problem in the presence of explicit solvent. The original nemd mc scheme is separated into two steps. The protonation state of a site is randomly attributed via a metropolis mc process on the basis of an intrinsic pka. An attempted nonequilibrium switch is generated only if this change is accepted. A force field - dependent offset constant must be ascribed to each type of titratable site in a molecule. The simulation method is tested with single amino acids in solution. For each type of titratable site , an offset constant can be determined via an explicit solvent alchemical fep calculation on a corresponding reference molecule. An amino acid dipeptide typically provides a reasonably good reference system for ionizable side chains. The value of these offset constants depends on the details of the mm force field. A preidentified ionizable site is allowed to spontaneously protonate and deprotonate as a function of time. The goal is to design a constant - ph simulation such that it generates the proper boltzmann equilibrium distribution for the system. In practice this is difficult to implement because of the strong coupling due to the large variations in electrostatic energy accompanying changes in the protonation state. To circumvent this problem we adopt a hybrid simulation method that combines the advantages of monte carlo ( mc) with the strengths of classical molecular dynamics ( md) The proposed move is inherently symmetric. The acceptance or rejection probability is given by the metropolis criterion. The transition probability of a proposed move tp and the probability to accept or reject the proposed move ta are shown in figure 2. A metropolis\\xa0criterion\\xa0is applied after the second stage of the switching process. The switching trajectory when attempting a change  in protonation state has some analogies with the short ti calculations carried out to evaluate the free energy difference associated with the change. The metropolis mc criterion applied to the discrete end state in the present hybrid nemd mc algorithm formally resolve the issues arising from the poorly converged thermodynamic integration. The algorithm can be redesigned to take advantage of the information about the inherent pka of the site.  transition probability for  describing a protonation / deprotonation process according to some inherent pka of the site and t is the transition probability of an attempted x  x nemd switch. The first step does not involve any changes in the atomic coordinates of the system. complex changes in atomic coordinates are absorbed into the second step. A number of methods could be used to generate the random walk in. There are two stages for implementing a constant - ph hybrid simulation method. In the first stage, the free energy gaa of the protonated state relative to the unprotonatedState must be calculated for all the ionizable amino acids. Then, the empirical offset constant caa must be used to shift the extended ph - dependent mm potential energy (r, ) to carry out the simulation. The proton is treated as a dummy noninteracting particle for the un Protonated State. A number of internal mm covalent terms ( bonds, angles, dihedrals) are kept to avoid the problem of a wandering noninteracting free proton in the simulation. Their influence cancels out in the treatment of the standard state. The empirical offset constant caa must be based on gaa , also calculated from an alchemical fep simulation. The first protocol based on eqs 30 and 31 yields more efficient hybrid simulations because the two charging free energies appear in opposite directions of the alchemical processes. The second protocol is less advantageous because it requires the creation of opposite charges during the switch process. The equations of motion were integrated with a 2 fs time step and shake was used to constrain covalent bonds involving hydrogen atoms. In the case of aspartic and glutamic acids, two dummy hydrogen are introduced to allow the two carboxylate oxygen atoms to be protonated. In the unprotonated state, one of the two hydrogen particles is alchemically transformed into a fully interacting hydrogen atom. The number of special counterion water molecules able to interconvert into a water molecule were included in the simulation. Nemd switching simulations are carried out in the nve ensemble with no constant temperature or pressure control. For peptides and proteins with multiple ionizable sites, a maximum of one protonation site is perturbed per cycle. For the nemd switches, the momenta of all particles in the system are treated according to a symmetric two - ends momentum reversal prescription. In omtky3, the ionization of five acidic residues is coupled to a counterion water molecule via eq 30 ( there are no basic sites) In hewl, the ionsize of nine acidic residues ( glu7, asp18, glu35, gli48, glp52, glg87, glgu119) is paired to a water molecule. We report the net computational cost of the hybrid simulation by adding the number of time steps used for both the equilibrium md and nemd simulations. Mc simulation was generated for the hewl system ( separated into 30 simulations with randomized initial conditions to reduce the computational time ) Each cycle of the hybrid simulation included 10 ps of equilibrium md and 50 ps of nemd for the switching. For each test case the pka of each protonation site is calculated as34where p1 and p0 are the probability of the protonated and deprotonated states being extracted from the simulation. The crooks equation states that35where pf is the forward work probability distribution. equation 35 can be transformed into36let us define37then ,  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 eq 36 becomes38we fitted q(w ) and w observed from simulations to eq 38 and calculated the coefficient of determination  ( r ) In principle, it should be possible to optimize the switching time to maximize the efficiency of the algorithm. The longest trajectory, simulation 7, has a total length of 600 ns. For hewl, the rmsd error of calculated pka s compared to experiment is 0.93 ( table 3) The average acceptance ratio for each residue in the hybrid simulations of omtky3 is shown in table 4. The total number of successful transitions increases 1.6-fold compared with those for simulation 6. The acceptance ratio can get as high as 10% for glu10 or as low as 0.8% for asp27. In simulations 1 and 7, switching trajectories of 50 ps were used for asp7 and glu19. In a follow-up simulation, the average acceptance ratio increased by a factor of 3. However, the overall efficiency of the algorithm is lower because of the longer switching length. Protonation / deprotonation processes are separated into two steps. The protonation state of a site is randomly attributed via a metropolis mc process. A nonequilibrium switch is generated only when this change in state is accepted. The method was illustrated with application to turkey ovomucoid third domain and hen egg - white lysozyme. It is possible to carry out constant - ph simulations without compensating for the change in total charge. The sampling time is expected to grow linearly with the number of titratable sites. A number of enhancements of the method will be considered in the near future. While the algorithm considered only independent protonation and deprotonation attempts in the applications presented here, it is possible that including correlated attempts would be useful.',\n",

       " 'iron overload contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality in patients receiving regular red blood - cell transfusions. Administration of effective iron - chelation therapy that results in net negative iron balance is the only way to prevent end - organ damage from iron deposition in various tissues. deferoxamine ( dfo ) is an effective iron chelator that has been shown to improve survival in iron - overloaded -thalassemia patients. deferiprone received fda approval only in october 2011 for treatment of patients with transfusional iron overload. The highest dose of deferasirox approved by most health authorities is 30 mg / kg / day. Most recently the fda and european medicines agency have approved doses up to 40 mg /kg / day in patients not adequately chelated. The most common drug - related adverse events were mild to moderate in severity and often self - limiting.  deferasirox has proved to be an effective , safe oral iron - chelating agent in patients with thalassemia. adverse effects ( optic neuropathy , retinal pigmentation ) , ototoxicity , anaphylactic reactions , pulmonary fibrosis , and rarely renal impairment.  deferasirox was generally well tolerated over the long term in both pediatric and adult patients. gastrointestinal adverse effects ( 9% ) and increased serum creatinine ( 11% ) were transient and mild to moderate in severity. renal and liver functions were closely monitored during the trial. No progressive increases in serum creatInine or liver transaminase levels were observed. The efficacy of deferasirox in reducing cardiac iron and thereby preventing cardiac iron loading was assessed by measuring myocardial t2 * in a subgroup of patients with -thalassemia ( n = 192 ) who were enrolled in the large evaluation of patients iron chelation with exjade ( epic ) trial. A value of < 20 ms is considered to indicate cardiac iron levels below the normal range , whereas a value < 10 ms is associated with reduction in left and right ventricular ejection fraction.  deferasirox was well tolerated overall , with manageable side effects and good safety profile. There were no negative effects noted on physical or gonadal development in children ; however , longer follow - up studies are needed to make such claims. Another important result of the study was a statistically significant improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction observed by week 52.  deferasirox treatment resulted in statistically significant and similar reductions in lic compared to dfo. The most notable adverse effects irrespective of the relationship to study medication were transient gastrointestinal disturbances and skin rash. serum ferritin levels in patients with 4 years of deferasIROx exposure significantly decreased by 591 ng / ml. The most common adverse effects in the study were transient and mild , with diarrhea and headaches reported in 22.6% patients each. Three patients ( 9.5% ) were noted to have nonprogressive increase in serum creatinine. Overall survival and leukemia - free survival are significantly shorter in transfusion - dependent mds patients. There are several published guidelines recommending iron. - chelation therapy in chronically transfused mds patients. The main factors taken into account are life expectancy, transfusion burden, evidence of iron excess ( elevated ferritin ) and related comorbidities. The results of the ongoing telesto ( myelodysplastic syndromes event - free survival with iron chelation Therapy study ) trial are much awaited. In a recent multicenter trial , nolte et al evaluated the efficacy and safety of deferasirox ( mean daily trial dose 19 mg / kg ) in 50 low- or intermediate-1-risk ( ipss ) mds patients. A significant reduction of ferritin and hematological improvement was reported in six patients ( 11%). The largest prospective trial to date ( epic) enrolled 341mds patients among a total of 1,744 patients.  iron chelation with deferasirox in mds patients seems to have favorable effects on hematopoiesis. The rate of drug discontinuation due to adverse effects was reported as 24.8% in the us03 trial. The most common toxicities reported in this patient population were nausea, diarrhea, and skin rash.  deferasirox is not fda - approved for treatment of iron overload in hh. serum ferritin levels declined by 63.5% , 74.8% , and 74.1% in the 5, 10, and 15 mg / kg cohorts. 7 patients discontinued treatment due to adverse effects.

The patient was asked to make a food diary as a part of the self - monitoring activity. The patient was however not very honest with the same as he did not consider his eating to be a problem and would consume food secretly. The onset of eating disorder was temporally correlated with trauma to the frontal lobe.  pfc dysfunction is seen to be disturbed in various illnesses that involve prefrontal - subcortical systems. tbi can damage frontotemporal structures which can induce a lack of self- restraint in eating. literature also suggests that substance use and eating disorders can both be conceptualized as maladaptive impulsive and compulsive behaviors.

       " 'The role of critical care nurses in the management of continuous renal replacement therapies ( crrt ) in intensive care units ( icu) is currently a matter of debate. Many centres have applied a collaborative approach where nurses from the dialysis unit ( du ) intervene during a crrt session. This may have a positive effect on dialysis timings and costs , as well as increasing the responsibilities and duties of nurses at the bedside. No general rule has ever been recommended for crrt in the icu. Of the 130 participants attending the meeting, 120 filled out the questionnaire ( 92% ) 119 questionnaires were analysed ( 114 nurses, 2 medical doctors , and 3 dialysis technicians ) Most of the participants worked in an adult setting, but 47 ( 39% ) stated that they had paediatric expertise. Only 34% of critical care nurses had attended a crrt training program. In 49% of cases, both trained and untrained nurses were allowed to manage crrt. Only 2% of nurses believed this requirement to be essential for their unit. Only 25% of respondents claimed that nurses should only be in charge of basic functions. The third part of the survey was dedicated to particular crrt set ups and settings. A perfusion nurse was present and shared patient workload in 50% of cases when a crrt patient was connected to an ecmo machine. The main finding of this study was that in italy no standardized protocol exists on crrt nursing management in the icu. The responsibility for crrt in the icu differs significantly according to the institution. Half of employees handling crrt machines have never received any specific training. A well - trained nurse would be able to handle every aspect of a crrt session. Specific training also improves circuits patency and reduces avoidable errors during crrt troubleshooting. Results confirmed existing ( if unverified ) knowledge about crrt practice in italy. The role of italian nurses in the treatment of crrt patients is not standardized and requires significant modification. It is possible that intensive standardized training and educational programs may help resolve this issue.',\n",
       " ' multistate collaboratives or networks have become a more prevalent mode for implementing health care quality improvement initiatives. states can learn from each other as well as from experts about successful practices and policies. the sharing of information can take place rapidly and without the significant time lag needed for published research to become available. Evidence provided to the states through these collaboratives comes in varying forms including data analysis results, literature reviews, expert presentations , and even anecdotal references from peers. This commentary examines these benefits and illustrates the importance of quality improvement collaborations to decision - making in state medicaid programs. The first project dealt with antipsychotic medication use in children and adolescents;5 the second examined hospital admissions and readmissions , while the third focused on early elective deliveries. The companion paper describes in detail the methods used to conduct them. The present commentary focuses on the benefits of such studies and their importance to quality improvement in medicaid. Medicaid pays for up to 48 percent of the births nationally ( 1.8 million births),2223 the program has a clear vested interest in developing policies to reduce complications and costs associated with these early elective deliveries. This study initially found that , of the medicaid singleton deliveries in 22 states , early Elective deliveries are prevalent and that states can improve their reported rates. 1 in 12 adults discharged from a hospital was readmitted within 30 days, adding an additional $ 16 billion to health care costs in the united states. readmissions were costly for the states and were more prevalent in those with certain diagnoses such as mental health. readmission rates varied considerably among the 19 participating states, allowing states with higher rates to learn from those with lower rates. Medicaid is currently at the vortex of policy making for the nation s lowest - income , most vulnerable , and sickest residents. As medicaid expands under the affordable care act ( aca ) the size and importance of this vulnerable population will increase. This will bring new demands to the program and heighten the need for these collaborative , rapid learning projects.  states have used the findings from the reports in a variety of ways. These include to identify and correct problems such as disparities, to set policies, to plan within the state, and to continue to monitor the data on their own. These studies are especially important in that there is a relative dearth of published research relying on medicaid administrative data. Multistate clinical quality projects conducted by the mmds offer a key mechanism to help medicaid monitor program outcomes across the country. These studies respond to crucially important national health and policy concerns for the medicaid population. medicaid is currently at the vortex of policy making for the nation s lowest - income , most vulnerable , and sickest residents.  states have used the findings from the reports in a variety of ways.

The importance of a learning network in medicaid will grow rapidly as medicaid expands under the aca to take on more of the nation s most vulnerable and costly individuals. information on both quality outcomes for the population as well as cost . the importance of an effective learning network will grow.',\n",
       " 'our criteria for the diagnosis of dka included plasma glucose > 250 mg / dl, hco3 < 15 meq / l , ph < 7.3 , and moderate ketones in the urine or blood by the nitroprusside method. A total of 37 patients were prospectively randomly assigned to three groups as follows. responses to therapy were based on the time to achieve a glucose level of 250 mg/ dl. The treatment and care of patients was managed by the dka team. Random assignment of patients to different insulin regimens was done after arrival at the crc. Because a priming dose of insulin adds an additional risk of hypokalemia, potassium levels were assessed and corrected on an hourly basis. Routine blood chemistry values measured by standard assays in the clinical chemistry laboratory. Plasma free insulin , c - peptide , -hydroxybutyrate , acetoacetate , pyruvate , lactate , cortisol , and ffas were assayed. Overall mean comparisons for means and slopes for the three groups ( load , no load , and twice no load ) were made with one - way anova. All measured parameters reached their near - normal values at recovery , with total ketone bodies reaching 3.5 mmol / l. of interest was the ffa level, which at recovery was about twice the normal value but consistent with elevated levels of ffa in diabetic patients without dka. The twice no load group maintained higher levels of insulin during 30120 min of infusion than those of the load or no load groups. The length of hospitalization was not significantly different among the groups. Table 2 shows biochemical data on admission and at complete recovery from dka in the three groups. No statistically significant differences among any of the parameters in the groups on admission. cortisol values are lower in the no load group than in the other two groups. All measured parameters reached their near - normal values at recovery. 5 of 12 patients in the no load group required additional insulin for control of their blood glucose. The length of hospitalization was not significantly different among the groups. There were no complications in any of the groups and no deaths occurred in this cohort. The slopes for glucose , venous ph , ketones , ffas , bicarbonate , and cortisol varied among treatment groups. An adequate continuous insulin infusion such as 0.14 unit  kg  h ( or 10 units / h in a 70-kg patient ) is used. A dose of 0.07 unit kg h without priming is not adequate to obtain desired changes in glucose without supplemental doses of insulin.',\n",
       " \"3d computed tomography ( ct) provides accurate and detailed information for diagnosis and treatment planning of dentofacial deformities. Despite the many advantages of 3d ct, detailed occlusal and accurate interocclusal data can not be obtained. Image quality is affected by artifacts induced by various factors such as beam hardening, extinction, scatter and noise. Images were saved in digital imaging and communication in medicine ( dicom ) format and imported into imaging software ( invivodental 5.0) 3d surface models were constructed by using segmentation threshold values ranging from 600 to 3,071 according to the program 's default function and converted to stereolithographic format. Each restored model was registered with the control model by using the iterative closest point algorithm20 in 3d reverse engineering software.  artifacts were present not only on the second premolar but also on the adjacent teeth and mostly on the buccal and lingual surfaces. The maximum linear discrepancy was the least for the small occlusal restoration and the greatest for the mesiooccluso - distal restoration. artifacts appear in the horizontal direction , not vertically , on 3d surface models. The maximum linear discrepancy was the least and greatest in models of the small occlusal and mesio - occluso - distal restorations. positive relationships between the extent of artifact and the restoration size were also observed in the artifact area and intensity measurements. artifact reduction should be taken into consideration for a proper diagnosis and treatment planning when using 3d surface models.  scan field , voxel size , segmentation threshold value , and dental material type. be useful for assessing various artifact - inducing factors , such as scan field, voxels, and size of teeth. scan field can be used to assess various artifact-inducing factors, such as the size of the teeth and scan field.\",\n",
       " \"vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic used in the treatment of severe infections with pathogens such as staphylococcus and streptococcus spp. It is poorly metabolized and is mainly excreted unchanged in urine. It has a low volume of distribution ( 0.6 l / kg ) and a low protein - bound fraction ( 50% ) suggesting that it can easily diffuse through dialysis membranes. Vancomycin clearances are reduced in patients with impaired renal function. accumulation of unchanged active drug in plasma is likely to occur. application of existing nomograms or equations should be accompanied by monitoring. It has been suggested that a plasma concentration of 80 g / ml would be a reliable level for the toxicity threshold. Studies of the pharmacokinetics of vancomycin in patients undergoing haemodialysis with high flux membranes demonstrated that there is a rebound in drug concentrations at the end of the session. This rebound may result from drug recirculation from plasma protein binding sites. When a continuous technique is used, there is no rebound in the drug's plasma concentration. maintenance doses should be administered according to the plasma trough levels. Vancomycin therapy is widely used in patients with decreased renal function. Serum levels of this agent must be closely monitored in such patients in order to avoid toxicity and subtherapeutic levels. emergence of resistance to glycopeptide antibiotics has been noted in some patients.\",\n",
       " 'Stereotactic radiosurgery ( srs) has been developed and widely used in the field of spine tumor treatment. One of the major complications associated with srs is vertebral compression fracture ( vcf) In cases of osteolytic spinal tumors, vertebral body and pedicle are eroded by tumor mass. A modified weinstein - boriani - biagini ( wbb) classification system was adopted to assess the extent of tumor infiltration in the whole vertebral body. The rate of whole vertebral body involvement was defined as the ratio of the number of tumor - infiltrated sectors to whole sectors ( sector 1 - 12) vertebral bodies osteolysis rate is defined as ratio of number of tumors - infiltrated to sectors 4 - 9. Only vertebral body osteolysis rate was predictive of vcf development ( p=0.016 ) patients whose vertebralBody was destroyed by more than 60% showed an 8.4 times higher risk of vCF. pre - srs deformity ( p.31) and sins ( p =0.07) were not significant predictive factors. ten patients underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty and 5 underwent fusion surgery to treat pain associated with post-srs vcf. In the present study , the incidence of vcf was 36% , which was higher than the risk reported by other authors. The present findings suggested whole vertebral body involvement rate , pre - srs deformity , vertebralBody osteolysis rate , and sins as risk factors for vcf. The presence of a lytic tumor , specific histology ( lung and hepatocelluar carcinoma metastasis ) and radiation dose of 20 gy were predictive factors of vCF. Osteoradionecrosis is the proposed mechanism of srs induced vcf. It is a slow - healing radiation - induced ischemic necrosis of the bone tissue. A high radiation dose damages collagen, which reduces bone toughness. radiation progressively degrades the strength, ductility , and toughness of theBone tissue. Percutaneous cement augmentation procedures were used more commonly ( 77% ) than spinal stabilization surgery ( 23% ) The choice of surgical intervention is determined by radiological finding of the spine. The systemic status of the patient and extent of metastatic burden need to be carefully considered when deciding on surgical options.',\n",
       " 'Over 13 million patients aged 60 years and over were admitted to public hospitals in Brazil. More than 1.2 million of these patients died while they were in the hospital, corresponding to 56.4% of total deaths. Poor nutrition, functional decline, cognitive deficits, illness severity and polypharmacy have all been correlated to higher mortality rates after discharge. All 922 patients admitted to the geriatric care unit from february 2004 to october 2007 were evaluated for possible inclusion in this study. Patients were evaluated daily by the multidisciplinary health team and any presence of delirium and infections was reported. serum creatinine and albumin levels were recorded because of their clinical importance. statistical analysis was carried out comparing data obtained from patients who were discharged and patients who died. In the study sample of 856 individuals, infectious complications of the respiratory and urinary tracts were the most common causes of death. The patients ranged in age from 60 to 104 years old , with an average of 78.43  8.62 years of age. A high level of functional dependency was present , with approximately one third of the patients having a diagnosis of immobility. Delirium, cancer and heart failure diagnoses, age , immobility , serum albumin levels lower than 3.3 mg / dl at admission and serum creatinine levels equal to or higher than 1.3mg / d l were identified as independent factors related to higher mortality in hospitalized older patients. The continuous growth of the geriatric population in recent decades has led to an increasing number of acute hospitalizations. 34.8% of our delirium - diagnosed patients died during hospitalization. Delirium is one of the earliest clinical manifestations of older patients acute ailments and has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality. In agreement with previous studies , a higher prevalence of immobility was observed among the patients who died. This diagnosis was confirmed as an independent factor associated with higher mortality. in , besides implying higher in - hospital mortality levels,37 are also associated with death in the general elderly population. comorbidities are a key factor in mortality prediction among older in - patients , and heart failure has been described and corroborated by our study as one of the strongest influences on these individuals outcomes. delirium, neoplastic diseases, immobility , congestive heart failure history , albumin levels lower than 3.3 mg / dl and advanced age are all highly correlated to the mortality of hospitalized older patients.',\n",

       " 'The tumor suppressor function of p53 is compromised in essentially all human cancers. Small - molecule inhibitors designed to block the mdm2p53 interaction can liberate the tumor suppressors function of  p53 and may have a promising therapeutic potential for cancer treatment. The study led to the discovery of 60 ( aa-115/apg-115) , a highly potent, chemically stable and efficacious mDM2 inhibitor, which has entered clinical development. In a search for superior compounds we modeled the structure of compound 6 in a complex with mdm2 based upon the cocrystal structure of 2 complexed with human mDM2. guided by this model we performed extensive modifications on five regions of the molecule. We began by replacing the 4-hydroxycyclohexyl group at site d in compound 6 with a methyl group , giving compound 7. We then replaced the cyclo hexyl group with 4-tetrahydro-2h - pyran generated compound 11, which achieves strong tumor growth inhibition but not complete tumor regression in mice. position of the cyclohexyl group in compound 6 resulted in compound 12 , which has a good affinity to mdm2 ( ki = 9.8 nm ) but is 4 times less potent than 6. introduction of two methyl groups at the same 4-position in 6 yielded compound 15, which is several times more potent than 12. To improve solubility , we inserted one or more nitrogen atoms into the aryl rings producing compounds 16, 17, 18, and 19 ( table 2) We found that heteroaromatic rings with carboxylic acid substituents have the best binding affinities with ki values between 1 and 3 nm. We found that the thiophene group in 20 can be oxidized during the oxidative removal of the chiral auxiliary, preventing further investigation of this compound. compounds 31, 32, and 33 are more than 3 times more potent than 6.  compound 33 was administered via oral gavage at 100 mg / kg daily for 14 days. It was incubated in ch3cn / h2o , meoh / h 2o , or cell culture media. While compound 33 can effectively retard tumor  growth , it failed to achieve tumor regression. The carboxylic group assists in the decomposition of 33. A series of compounds containing an n - arylcarboxamide substituent were synthesized and tested. The cell growth inhibition of sjsa-1 cells by these compounds was determined. compounds 39 ( mi-1061 ) and 44 displayed the best cellular activity among the compounds in this series.  compound 54 was administered via oral gavage at 50 or 100 mg / kg daily for 14 days and compound 2 was administered at 100mg / kg. Compounds 39 and 54 achieve considerably lower cmax and auc values than compound 2 in the sjsa-1 osteosarcoma tumor xenograft model in mice. Compound 55 binds to mdm2 with a high affinity but is 5 times less potent than compound 39 in inhibition of cell growth.  compound 56 at 100 mg / kg administered daily for 14 days demonstrates only a very moderate tumor growth inhibition in the sjsa-1 xenograft model in mice. The antitumor activity of 56 is much inferior to that achieved by 2, 39, and 54. We investigated three strategies to improve the tissue penetration.  compounds 59 and 60 bind to mDM2 with a high binding affinity ( ki < 1 nm , table 7 ) . both compounds potently inhibit cell growth in the sjsa-1 cell line with ic50 values of 70 and 60 nm , respectively , and are thus as potent as compound 56. compound 59 or 60 orally administered at 30 mg / kg daily for 14 days effectively inhibits  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 tumor growth. compound\\xa059 or 60 administered at 100 mg /kg daily for14 days effectively achieves complete and long - lasting tumor regression.  compounds 56, 59, and 60 cause no or minimal weight loss during the entire experiment. compounds 59 and 60 achieve a cmax value similar to that of 2 but have a 2 times higher auc than compound 2. compounds 60 and 56 inhibit cell growth in cancer cell lines with wild - type p53 and display outstanding selectivity. To explore achiral substituents in carbon-2 of  the pyrrolidine core, the compounds in table 1 were synthesized using the method outlined in scheme 4. The compounds ( 1620 ) in table 2 were obtained by using the intermediates ( 16b20b ) , which are equivalent to 61. Several five - membered heteroaromatic rings were formed  from the carboxylic acid ( 66) The acid was converted to the corresponding carboxamide ( 67) The thioamide ( 68) was reacted with an -bromoketone in a hantzsch thiazole synthesis reaction. The thiazoles 69 and 70 were further elaborated by amide coupling. The carboxylic acid compounds 22 and 26 were produced by hydrolysis of the esters in compounds 73 and 80. The compounds in tables 4 and 5 were obtained  by the synthesis outlined in scheme 8. When n - arylamines were used, hatu failed to accomplish the coupling but the coupling was successful when the acid was activated with ph2pocl. Spirooxindoles contain two substituents at the carbon-2 of the pyrrolidine core as mdm2 inhibitors. compound 60 is very stable in solutions and has excellent oral pharmacokinetics. It effectively activates p53 in the sjsa-1 xenograft tumor tissue in mice.

       " 'increasing findings have evidenced that cerebral ischemia plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of vascular cognitive impairment. reduction of cerebral blood flow correlates with the severity of cognitive impairment in rats. The transcription factor cyclic amp response element binding protein ( creb ) and neurotrophin brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( bdnf) have emerged as molecules that may play an important role in modulating mood, behavior, and memory. The animal model of cerebral ischemia was established with permanent bilateral occlusion of both common carotid arteries. rats were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate ( 350 mg / kg intraperitoneally ) and breathed normally throughout the surgical procedure. minocycline ( 100 mg / capsule ; huishi pharmaceutical limited company ) was diluted to 0.5 mg / ml density by normal saline. The spatial probe test was for the measurement of preservation - of - experience ( memory ) capacity. The time it took to find the unmoved platform ( learning latency ) and the times a rat crossed the corresponding position of the removed platform in 120 seconds ( memory latency ) were recorded. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells were routinely isolated and the slides were prepared with a cytospin. The animal model of cerebral ischemia was established with permanent bilateral occlusion of both common carotid arteries. The investigation was performed according to the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals published by the us national institutes of health. minocycline ( 100 mg / capsule ; huishi pharmaceutical limited company , shanghai , the people s republic of china ) was diluted to 0.5 mg / ml density. The morris water maze task is widely used in behavioral neuroscience to study spatial learning and memory. rats were placed in a large circular pool with an invisible platform that allows them to escape the water. The time it took a rat to find the platform and escape was measured for up to four trials a day for 5 days. tissue samples were collected after surgery and immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen. Rat tissues were dissected and homogenized in tissue protein extraction reagent ( t - per ) buffer in the presence of protease inhibitors. After homogenization , the lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 g and the supernatants were saved for western blotting. Equal amounts of lysate were subject to sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotts. The optical densities of the specific bands were scanned and measured by image analysis software ( tongji qianping company, wuhan , hubei province , people s republic of china) b ) . the number of times the platform position was crossed for mt animals was significantly increased compared to bccao rat groups in the corresponding platform position ( p=0.0016 ) ( figure 1b) . the results of immunohistochemistry and western blotting showed that expression of creb and pcreb in the mt group was significantly higher than that of the m group at the corresponding time. Cerebral ischemia was induced in 10-week - old wistar rats by bccao. rats were subjected to the morris water maze. escape latency decreased after 1 day of training. on days 3, 4, and 5, s animals immediately swam toward the platforms in the water maze, whereas m rats swam longer distances before finding the platform. expression of creb and pcreb by immunohistochemistry in the m groups was more decreased than in the control group ( p=0.0009) The number of times the platform position was crossed during the probe trial for the s group was higher than for m rats ( p=0.0021) western blotting analysis found that bdnf in the mt groups was higher. than that of the m group ( p =0.0006) We inferred that downregulation of creb , pcreb , and bdnF contributed to cognitive impairment from chronic cerebral ischemia.  minocycline reduced cognitive impairment caused by permanent bilateral occlusion of both common carotid arteries. The expression of creb , a bio - marker of memory,39 was examined in the hippocampus tissue of rats. creb has a role to play in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment and in anti - cognitive impairment action.  bdnf is involved in structural remodeling and neuronal plasticity. It is a potential target for cerebral ischemia damage. Minocycline has an anti - cognitive impairment - like effect in behavioral models of vascular cognitive impairment through enhancing the expression of bdnF in the hippocampus. This study is the first to evaluate the influence of minocycline on the transcription factors ( creb , pcreb , and bdnf ) as potential key players in the treatment of vascular cognitive impairment in the process of cerebral ischemia injury. From a clinical point of view , the ability of mincycline to modulate cognitive impairment may be of great importance in the selection of neuroprotective agents.',\n",
       " 'The latrunculins constitute a family of macrolide natural products isolated from the taxologically unique marine sponges cacospongia mycofijiensis and negombata magnifica. One compound,  ( + ) -18-epi - lat runculol a ( 1) exhibited selective solid tumor cytotoxicity when tested against hct-116 ( 5.5  m ) and mda - mb-435 ( > 50 m) The parent compounds ( +) -latrunculin a ( 2 ) and b ( 3) demonstrate nonselective cytot toxicity profiles, thus limiting their use as chemotherapeutics. Our synthetic strategy for ( + ) -18-epi - latrunculol a ( 1) was envisioned to exploit the lessons learned in our earlier syntheses. We envisioned a late - stage mitsunobu macrolactonization and either a wittig olefination or , given our earlier difficulties with the witig union for lat runculin a, a nucleophilic addition protocol. The requisite southern hemisphere coupling partner 4 was in turn envisioned  to be readily accessible from cyclic ketal 5 via a strategy  grotesque level acid - mediated cyclization / equilibration of -hydroxy enone 6. Alcohol ( )-13 was readily  prepared utilizing a previously reported three - step sequence. The key acid - mediated cyclization of ( + ) -6 was next achieved after extensive  experimentation by subjecting -hydroxy enone ( +) -6 to a 1:1.3 ( v / v ) mixture of 6 n hcl and thf. Wittig olefination was next envisaged to unite the northern and southern hemispheres of ( + ) -18-epi - latrunculol a  ( 1) The reaction had been conducted under strictly anhydrous and deoxygenated conditions. The reaction was carried out in three steps from ketal ( +) -5. Aldehyde ( + ) -24 was next prepared in six steps from known alkynyl diol ( )-22 ( scheme 8) It was then exposed to acetic acid - buffered tbaf to remove the primary tbs group. This led to complete isomerization of the trisubstituted enoate. doering conditions then provided the requisite northern - hemisphere aldehyde. The desired union of the northern and southern hemispheres was achieved to funish ( + ) -25 in 95% yield. prolonged drying of the zn(otf)2 proved to be critical for the success of this union. The stereochemistry of the newly formed propargylic alcohol  was confirmed via conversion to acetonide ( +) -26. The synthesis of ( + ) -latrunculin a ( 2 ) proved to be completely unworkable because of the incompatible conditions required for removal of the pmb protecting group. A similar mitsunobu macrolactonization employed  in the original smith synthesis of  ( +) -lat runculin (2) was also unsuccessful. Although the global deprotection was achieved, removal of both sem protecting groups required extended reaction times ( > 12 h ) at elevated temperature ( 50 c) Semireduction employing either the lindlar  or p-2 nickel boride catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere did not proceed. The c nmr spectrum of synthetic ( + ) -18-epi - latrunculol a ( 1 ) proved problematic. When taken in acetone - d6 as reported by crews , the carbon resonances appeared doubled in several cases. We observed both h2o and dho peaks in the h nmr spectrum and thus speculated that a deuterium equilibrium exchange had occurred to account for the mixture observed in the c nmr spectra. Taking extreme care to introduce the acetone - d6 under a strictly nitrogen atmosphere greatly reduced the amount of h2a and dh peaks. The doubled carbon resonances were converted to a single set of resonances for deuterated 18-epi - latrunculol a. We have reported here the total synthesis of ( + ) -18-epi - latrunculol a ( 1) using a longest linear sequence of 20 steps from commercially available 5-hexenoic acid. We have also reported on the selection of diol protection and successful optimization of the alkyne. Biological evaluation of the natural product and synthetic intermediates and further development of the tandem cyclization / equilibration of trans--hydroxy enones are currently underway. rofuran ( thf ) , dichloromethane ( ch2cl2 ) , and toluene ( h2o) were obtained from a solvent purification system.

       " 'Laparoscopic adrenalectomy ( la ) has rapidly become the procedure of choice for the surgical management of most adrenal tumors. The use of la for pheochromocytomas is still controversial and the role of this procedure continues to be undefined. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risks and outcome of la performed in our department with large ( > 6 cm ) and potentially malignant p heochrom Cytomas. All 5 patients received preoperative preparation with alpha - blockers ( phenoxybenzamine ) , and in 3 of them a combination of beta - blockers was administered for treatment of tachycardia. During surgery, blood pressure was strictly monitored by arterial line and intravenous alpha- and beta - blockade was administered as necessary. An abdominal drain was placed in all patients for 20 hours to 24 hours on the adrenal bed. The diameter of the adrenal vein was about 2 mm to 5 mm , which is very small for these large pheochromocytomas. Vessel ligation performed through ultrasound scissors or endoscopic gastrointestinal approximator ( endogia ) stapler or laparoscopic clips even with monopolar electro diathermy wherever appropriate. No capsular disruption occurred during the tumor dissection. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy has become the preferred approach for surgical adrenal disease. The combination of pneumoperitoneum and the catecholamine effects of pheochromocytomas during laparoscopy present a unique perioperative management challenge to maintain hemodynamic stability. The mobilization of the gland from the inferolateral site to its anteromedial boundaries was very helpful and time saving. No severe hypotensive episode occurred after the total mass excision due to adequate intravascular volume expansion. In experienced hands, la can be proposed for large pheochromocytomas without preoperative signs of malignancy with no difference in postoperative morbidity or mortality.',\n",
       " \"Bite marks are usually seen in cases involving sexual assault , murder and child abuse. The severity of a bite mark is an important factor in the assessment of the forensic significance of the injury. The present study aimed to assess the most accurate bite mark overlay fabrication technique. It also aimed to determine the relative accuracy of the technique and its feasibility in forensic science. Dental characteristics of the biting edge and degree of rotation of the six upper and six lower anterior teeth were measured. Area of tooth biting surface was included to evaluate differences in the relative length and breadth of recorded individual teeth. overlay was produced by tracing the anterior teeth ( maxillary and mandibular ) on an acetate sheet using a fine - tipped felt pen. Study casts were placed on a glass plate of the photocopy machine with incisal edges down. acetate sheet was overlaid on photocopy image of the casts and the outline ofincisal edges was traced. The mean area and angle of rotation of overlays produced by the four methods were individually compared with the computerized technique. The amounts of variation in the area and the angle of rotated of individual teeth bite marks were assessed. The amount of variation in the area and the angle of rotation of individual teeth bite marks were assessed using mahalanobis distance by spss version 20 ibm co - operation switzerland. The mean distance and standard deviation obtained from the measurements of tooth area for six anterior teeth in maxillary and the mean value remained the same for all the methods ( 0.99 ) The standard deviation for xerographic - based method was the least ( 1.46 ) , followed by hand tracing from wax impression method (1.73) Wax method was best suited for 4 out of 12 teeth both in area and angle assessment. hand tracing and radiopaque wax methods were the least reliable showing higher distances from the standard. each person has a unique dentition which can be replicated and helps in identifying the victim. Xerographic overlay production method was found to be the most accurate method for determination of tooth area and angle of rotation among the four methods. wax impression method is not considered to be accurate because the area can increase with the depth of the bite on wax sheet which may alter based on the pressure applied. computer - based method is considered as a gold standard for bite mark analysis. No single technique has been shown to be better than the others and very little research has been carried out to compare different methods. This study evaluated the accuracy of direct comparisons between suspect 's models and bite marks with indirect comparisons in the form of conventional traced overlays of suspects. The xerographic technique was found to be the best.\",\n",
       " 'The dysregulated wnt signaling pathway is linked with cancer diseases and is also one of the most mutated signaling pathways in colorectal cancer carcinomas. Specific drugs which interrupt this misregulation might have high potential in targeted cancer therapy with low side effects especially in the aggressive chemotherapies. The searching for specific wnt pathway inhibitors as possible cancer drugs forged ahead during the last years although none of them finished clinical trials studies until now.  pcmv promotor was replaced by three top motifs ( 5-ccctttgatc-3 ) using restriction digest ( saci ) and pcr. The number of these motifs was doubled to gain 6 tcf binding motifs. The enhanced green fluorescence protein ( egfp ) sequence was inserted into the multiple cloning site subsequence and in frame with the lg-chain leader sequence and pdgfr domain. Wnt - specific response was monitored via fluorescence microscopy ( observer.z1 from zeiss , jena , germany ) and the associated software axiovision4.7 24 hours and 48 hours after addition of the activating agent. Up to 5  10 cells per sample were trypsinized , centrifuged , and resuspended in 0,5  ml of 0,1  pbs supplemented with protease inhibitor. Fishing of cells with activated wnt signaling pathway was carried out with the macs ( magnetic activated cell sorting ) system using ld columns and macs anti - gfp beads. fluorescence intensity was measured in an elisa reader ( tecan genios , mnnedorf , switzerland ) immediately , 24  h and 48  h after treatment using standard gfp filter sets. cell viability and fluorescence were observed every 24 hours after separation up to 3 days. Hekt - ste4 - 1 - 5 1c cells were seeded into 24-well plates and treated with several licl or wnt3a protein concentrations as described above. The fluorescence signal due to wnt pathway activation was the highest by the addition of 10  mm licl and after 24 hours and still visible 48 hours after treatment ( figure 2(a) ) . a higher fluorescence signals is also monitored in cells treated with wnt 3a although the signal magnification is not as high as in licl - treated cells. The technology is based on antibodies labeled with magnetic beads and thus can be caught with a magnetic field applied to the cell sorting columns. The positive sorted separation percentage was about 25% within licl activated cells and 6,4% among wnt3a activated cells. All sorted cells cultivated after sorting were viable and positive. A new reporter gene vector is introduced which is aiming to quantify wnt signaling state in a cell and capture it out of a cell pool at the same time. All cells separated by using our magnetic separation strategy were viable and could be used for further cultivation. This approach may be applied for identifying and fishing cells throughout primary cells or even for catching cells out of body fluids as part of a diagnostic procedure.

       " 'constipation in children is a common condition. The prevalence of constipation varies from 1% to 30% depending on the diagnostic methodology employed and the populations sampled. A recent study found france to have the highest prevalence ( 14.0% ) among the other european countries in the study. In france constipation has a higher reported prevalence than in many other eu countries. A large health care database was available to obtain these data. forlax ( ipsen pharma , paris , france ) is considered to be a frequently used peg for constipation in france. It was used to reflect patterns of hyperosmolar peg laxative use in that country. This study used patients prescribed the peg 4000 product trade - named forlax as a measure of hyperosmolar peg laxative use in france from 1997 to 2007. Data items included: age, gender, medical history ( event dates, diagnoses, risk factors , referrals to specialists ) , therapeutic history ( date / length of prescription, molecule / product , dose ) , additional information ( test results, immunizations, height , weight , blood pressure ) , and date of data input. There was an absolute increase in patients aged 018 years prescribed both doses of peg 4000. The relative proportion of patients prescribed peg 4000 in the 918 years age group declined from 93.4% in 1997 to 44.9% in 2007. The proportion of female patients prescribed the 10 g dose was greater than the proportion of males. There was a small increase in. of peg 4000 from 2003 to 2007 in all children ( aged 018 years ) , with 20,734 patients in 2003 and 58,691 in 2007 ( test of trend p = 0.01 ) ( table 3 , figure 3 ) . the relative proportion of patients prescribed peg 4000 in the 918 years age group declined from 13.6% in 2003 to 8.9% in 2007. There was a decrease in the number of. patients prescribed the 10 g dose , from 20, 734 in 2003. to 8030 in 2007, and a rise in the 4 g dose from 0 to 51,540. The study is the first to show and quantify off - label use of peg laxatives in france and describe its influence on prescription patterns. The statistical models have quantified the degree and pattern of changes in the use of hyperosmolar laxatives such as polyethylene glycol ( peg ) 4000 and demonstrate that the increases over time have been statistically significant. Study found that increases in prescriptions of laxatives to females were greater than in males between 1997 and 2007. Data from a nationally representative sample from the national ambulatory medical care survey , 1997 to 2006 observed an increase from 15% to 42% in the proportion of visits due to constipation where a ( unspecified ) hyperosmolar laxative was prescribed. There are several limitations to the present study which used data collected routinely for clinical care. by using a single trade - named product ( forlax ) as an indicator of peg 4000 use clinical opinion indicated that most children were given this product as the preferred peg 4000 during the years of the study. patient medical records in the database refer to unique patients except when patients move between physician practices and may be double counted. The study found large absolute levels of utilization of peg 4000 laxatives and increasing use over time in younger and older children. bowel cleansing may have accounted for a small number of prescriptions , more among pediatricians than among general practitioners. The results highlight the need for studies in other european countries to describe patterns and trends in utilization of different laxatives.',\n",

       " 'submental intubation allows unhindered access to the airway and facilitates reduction and fixation of complex maxillofacial fractures. The seldinger technique using a percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy kit ( pdtk ) ( cook critical care , europe) offers an interesting alternative to the classical blunt dissection technique. The pilot balloon after deflation was grasped with an artery forceps and pulled from within the mouth to the exterior. The tracheal tube was pulled in reverse order into the oral cavity and the breathing system was reattached. The skin wound was closed and no attempt was made to close the intraoral opening. No complications such as haemorrhage were encountered. The submental technique of endotracheal intubation is an accepted technique of airway management in patients with panfacial trauma undergoing corrective surgical procedures. We used percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy kit to modify the technique of submental intubated in four of our patients. This modification had the following potential advantages over the classical blunt dissection technique. It causes less tissue trauma , less scarring and gentler manipulations with minimal complications.',\n",
       " \"although the efficacy and effectiveness of screening and brief alcohol interventions ( sbi) have been shown to be strong , the implementation of sbi into routine care practice has not been satisfactory. Many implementation projects have tried to overcome known barriers such as lack of time, resources, training , and negative attitudes to working with sbi with limited success. implementation research suggests that a multifaceted strategy addressing several barriers may be more effective than simple training sessions. Study was part of the swedish implementation study spira ( secondary prevention implementation research on alcohol ) that aimed to study the implementation process of different sbi methods at primary health care centres ( phcs ) in sweden. A total of 30 focus group interviews were included in this study. The focus groups consisted of a mix of professionals working at the phc. The guide focused on themes including the staff 's experiences with working with risky drinkers and sbi. At the follow - up, themes regarding how their experiences had changed during the implementation period were added. The data were inductively analysed using content analysis. The purpose and the specific aim of this study were taken into deeper consideration. The analysis process continued with identification of meaning units responding to the aim. The meaning units were then labelled with codes and the codes were compared regarding similarities and differences. The codes were then categorized based on similarity of content to build categories. The categories were discussed and then sorted and abstracted into main categories and subcategories. Staff believed that alcohol problems could be the underlying cause of many of the symptoms that patients present at the phcs. There was a wish for alcohol work to be more visible for both patients and staff in order to facilitate the work. Participants could identify several situations where more systematic alcohol work could be performed. i think that the patient understands if you have the right knowledge ; they listen more to you. tend to listen more if they perceive that the person is knowledgeable and confident in discussing the issue. for some of us it would facilitate with more education in order to understand the limits for risky drinking. It would facilitate us a lot if we knew where to refer patients for additional help when we are insufficient. The participants perceived that they asked more patients about their alcohol habits after the implementation of the project. It was also seen that the phcs had integrated sbi into routine practice and that the staff asked special patients group more systematically about alcohol. The participants were also more aware about alcohol both at an individual level and at a phc level and discussed alcohol more among their colleagues. The greater awareness of alcohol and establishment of new routines seem to have been mediated by increased knowledge and skills about alcohol prevention. Participants knew more about their own limitations and when and where to refer patients if needed. They also experienced increased knowledge about alcohol and risky drinking and felt that they knew how to respond to risky drinkers to a greater extent. The aim of this study was to explore how the primary health care staff 's experiences of working with risky drinking changed during an implementation process. The fear of offending patients that was expressed at the baseline was not highlighted at all at the follow - up. Many of the participants said that they had never experienced that patients were offended by being asked about alcohol. Staff perceived that they did not work enough with sbi although they were motivated to do more. Lack of knowledge and confidence in bringing up the issue of alcohol was strongly emphasized at the baseline. Staff also expressed insecurity in how to introduce the issue and how to intervene. Sweden has made a strong national effort over 5 years to educate large sections of primary health care in sbi from 2004 to 2010.  increased at the follow - up and they stated that they had more confidence in bringing up the issue and giving a response and were able to go into the issue in greater depth. This indicates that the implementation was successful in increasing knowledge and confidence and that that effect lasted longer than the implementation period itself. Some of the staff still regard alcohol as a sensitive issue and that this affected their lack of confidence in talking about alcohol. Staff gain knowledge and confidence in working with alcohol screening and brief intervention when participating in an implementation study with an educational approach. The effects of participation lasted up to 6 months after the termination of the study. The decision to specify when to ask patients about their alcohol consumption decreased the sensitivity of asking the question. Staff at phcs in sweden are aware of the negative health consequences of alcohol and perceive that they seldom engage in alcohol screening and brief intervention. Staff perceived that lack of knowledge and the sensitivity of the topic contribute to low confidence in working with alcohol issues. participating in an implementation study where staff agree to perform sbi after a training session appears to have continued the learning - by - doing process.\",\n",

Local administration of metronidazole along with root planing and no plaque control reinforcement in case of experimental sites b appeared to be more effective in reducing pocket depth than oral administration. Local administration of metronidazole along with root planing and no plaque control reinforcement in case of experimental site b appeared to be more effective in reducing pocket depth than oral administration. This can be attributed to a greater effectiveness of local delivery of metronside rather than its systemic administration in periodontal therapy ( tables 4 and 5 ) The risk of developing systemic adverse effects is very unlikely in view of the very small quantity of metrosine administered.',\n",

Nilotinib can cause not only a simple elevation of the pancreatic enzyme levels , but also clinically significant pancreatitis. Further investigation is needed to determine the precise incidence, background characteristics, and risk factors underlying the symptomatic pancreatitis induced by nilotinib. We can not completely rule out hyperhistaminemia as the cause of epigastric pain because the histamine levels were not measured.',\n",

Its parent molecule was ctla4-ig ( abatacePT ) and resulted from the fusion of the extracellular domain of c tla4 with the constant region fragment of human igg1. It was proved to be highly effective for autoimmune t - cell - mediated autoimmune disorders but inadequate as a maintenance immunosuppressive agent. The benefit ( belatacept evaluation of nephroprotection and efficacy as first line immunosuppression trial ) study is a 3-year randomized phase iii clinical trial. Patients had a statistically significant lower risk of developing diabetes, need for treatment of hyperlipidemia, and a lower incidence of hypertension. The incidence of acute rejection was greater in mi ( 22% ) and li ( 17% ) bel atacept compared with csa ( 7% )  belatacept should be prescribed for ebv - seropositive patients only. clinical trials suggest that the use of bel atacept can lead to better renal function. as there is increased ptld risk in ebv- seronegative patients, belatacpt should only be prescribed to ebv seroneGative patients.

This li belatACEpt protocol is associated with low acute rejection rates , but maintains a renal and cardiovascular favorable profile. cp-690550 or tasocitinib is a synthetic orally available inhibitor of jak3. Its specificity makes it an interesting target for immunosuppression. in vitro and a double - blinded , placebo - controlled phase i trial assessing safety and tolerability of the drug reported that most adverse events were gastrointestinal or infectious. cp-690550 has the potential to improve current immunosuppression armamentarium. There still exist some concerns. Anemia is a common adverse event that has been reported in 30% of patients enrolled in the phase ii trial. Lower doses and new combination strategies should be explored. New molecules with high jak3 selectivity warranted. Sotrastaurin prolongs allograft survival in rats and cynomolgus monkeys. No signs of nephrotoxicity or hepatotoxicity at standard exposures. gastrointestinal effects were the dose - limiting toxicities in all species tested preclinically. In vitro tests indicated a modest potential for qt prolongation. Both sotrastaurin+mpa regimens were inferior to the control for the primary composite endpoint. composite efficacy failure rates were 7.8, 44.8 , and 34.1% at study end in the control and sotrasaurin groups. The sotasaurin - tacrolimus combination seems to be as effective as tacro limus - mpa , at least in the short term. CNN.com will feature iReporter photos in a weekly Travel Snapshots gallery.

We are presenting management of orbital floor fracture compounded with zygomatico - maxillary complex fracture using anterolateral wall of maxilla as bone graft and mini plates for fixation. Five patients with orbital floor defects of medium size average 1.16 cm size ( range 0.8 - 1.5 cm ) were grafted by using autogenous bone graft harvested from anterolateral wall of maxilla. All the patients were successfully reconstructed with restoration of the orbital wall continuity.

Dentists need to establish a friendly relationship with patients in order to combat patient fears and to deliver effective and efficient treatment. The perceptions of children regarding their dentists and dental care have not been previously assessed or documented. The questionnaire was administered to a total of 583 children including 289(49.6% ) females and 294(50.4% ) males. subjects were asked if they had been to the dentist before and if there were any physicians in the family. Each child was asked to choose between pictures to indicate their preference regarding the dentist s gender, attire , and protective equipment. Nine percent of children preferred that their dentist wear some type of protective equipment. Nine percent of the children preferred their dentist to wear a white coat instead of a colored one. eighty - eight percent of. the children reported that the dentist had a good smell. 11% of children in this study reported that they disliked their visit and another 12% reported that. they were afraid of the dentist. physical appearance has been shown to be a factor in a person s choice of a family physician. children prefer their dentist to wear the traditional formal attire with white coat in the dental clinic. assigning children to dentists of the same gender may improve the general comfort level of children in the dentist s office. children may be intimidated by protective devices such as masks and eye glasses. The children in this study favored a decorated dental clinic design with the toys and posters over a routine and bare clinic. The children cited injection , tooth extraction and dental tools as most scary and symbol of fear from dentistry. The results of this study present new insight about children s perception of dentists and the delivery of dental care.',\n",
       " 'Glaucoma is currently a leading cause of blindness in the world. Elevated intraocular pressure ( iop) remains the most important known risk factor. Daily use of eye drops requires patient dedication, understanding of the disease severity and ability to instill the medication. This interventional protocol adhered to the tenets of the declaration of helsinki and was approved by the institutional review board of unifieo in november 2013. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. consecutive patients with glaucoma and healthy participants with and without prior experience in placing eye drops were included.  eyedrop is a plastic device with blunt edges , easy to handle , in which the bottle is inserted. Based on its design and working mechanism , the device could be useful to help patients to overcome some of the previously cited difficulties , such as keeping their eyes open and avoiding contact of the tip to the globe. In this prospective study, consecutive patients with glaucoma were asked to instill eye drops in both eyes. Prior experience in eye drop instillation was defined as one year of continuous use of at least one topical medication. Exclusion criteria were history of prior ocular trauma or surgery, secondary glaucoma, uncontrolled iop, advanced disease, presence of any other ocular disease, and physical inability to handle the device. The device could be useful to help patients to overcome some of the previously cited difficulties , such as keeping their eyes open and avoiding contact of the tip to the globe. To evaluate the ease of instilling the eye drops, a visual analog scale ( vas) was used. The frequency of side effects between eyes ( with and without the applicator ) was compared using the mcnemar test. There was a higher frequency of positive device - related evaluations among participants without prior experience with eye drop instillation. conjunctival hyperemia was the most common side effect in both groups. no difference in the frequency of side effects or the distribution pattern of fluorescein between eyes was observed. The most common complaint was finding the right placement of the device on the orbit. The most studied device has been the xal - ease delivery system ( pfizer ophthalmics , new york , usa ) Different studies showed significant benefits with the use of the device. After one month, more than 70% of the patients reported being satisfied with using xal- ease without significant side effects. The study had a relatively small sample ( although it was satisfactory from a statistical point of view through the sample calculation for a power of 80% ) The use of the device neither resulted in loss of the hypotensive effect of the medication , nor did it increase the frequency of side effects.',\n",
       " 'type 1 diabetes ( t1d) is an immune - mediated disease in which insulin - producing -cells are destroyed. chronic therapy designed to alter the immune response may carry untoward effects that outweigh the benefits of therapy. This trial was designed for 2 years of therapy , with continued follow - up to evaluate risks and benefits after the prespecified primary study outcome at 2 years. The study protocol is available at the type 1 diabetes trialnet public web site : www.diabetestrialnet.org. The p values associated with the itt treatment comparisons of the primary and secondary end points are one - sided. The time to peak c - peptide falling to < 0.2 nmol / l was analyzed using the cox proportional hazards model. The c - peptide mean auc equals the auc divided by the 2-h interval ( i.e. , auc/120 ) The time to peak c- peptide falling to < 0.2 nmol / l was analyzed using the cox proportional hazards model. The data would suggest that this ratio is not constant and the estimate provides an approximate average.

These data suggest that costimulation blockade initiated within 3 months of diabetes onset transiently alters the natural history of disease progression. abatracept is a potential candidate to be tested in a trial for prevention of t1d in individuals determined to be at high risk for the disease. Four recent randomized trials with adequate sample size have demonstrated some preservation of -cell function in t1d. In all of these trials the treatment effect diminished with time , such that after an initial effect , c - peptide secretion subsequently declined parallel to the control group.

       " 'ipsilateral fractures of the proximal femur and femoral shaft are extremely uncommon injuries which occur in young adults who sustain a high energy trauma. A variety of management modalities have been tried to treat this complex fracture pattern ranging from conservative approach to recently introduced reconstruction nails. In our series 59.9% ( n = 23 ) were rated as good , 30.6% (N = 11 ) as fair , and 5.5% ( N = 2 ) as poor. We treated 36 patients with ipsilateral fractures of the femoral shaft with associated trochanteric or intracapsular neck fractures with a lpfn between december 2005 and december 2011. The majority of the injuries were the result of a motor vehicle accident. All the patients had plain radiographs of the pelvis including both hips, thigh and knee. Nail of appropriate size ( between 10 and 12 mm ) and of adequate length ( between 38 and 42 cm ) was implanted manually. Guide wire was passed through the tip of the trochanter distally after reducing the fracture shaft femur by closed manipulation. The mean duration for the surgery was 85 min ( range 55 - 105 min ) . active and passive exercises initiated within 72 h. Two cases of avascular necrosis of femoral head were detected after 2 years of followup. One patient had a femoral neck fracture which was initially missed and revised by long pfn after ten days of initial surgery. Another patient of fracture shaft femur presented to us after intramedullary nailing of femur with missed fracture neck femur. After followup of 4 months both the fractures united with limited terminal restriction of movements. The functional assessment system adopted by friedman and wyman13 was used for evaluating the results. The criteria used to evaluate our results included infection, pain, ability to work, shortening, range of movements at the hip and knee and rotational mal - alignment. The cervical screw was removed after consolidation. Close reamed antegrade i m nailing with supplemental screw fixation of ipsilateral femoral neck and shaft fractures did not produce uniformly successful results because of the high rates of varus malunion. The gamma nail is a versatile implant to deal with this complex fracture pattern , but the results with these implants on the indian femora have not achieved the success like its western counterparts. The lpfn is available in 130 - 135 and has a 6 proximal mediolateral angle. It allows the temporarily mechanically incompetent but biologically viable fragments to heal around the nail. The entry portal of the pfn through the trochanter limits the surgical injury predominantly to the tendinous hip abductor musculature. We conclude that ipsilateral fractures of the proximal femur and femoral shaft if diagnosed early and treated aggressively by lpfn gives a better functional result by a single implant. The results of the study were 30.9% good , 30.6% fair , and 5.5% poor.',\n",
       " ' thermal transportation along a nanowire mainly due to the scale - dependent carrier behavior upon nanoconfinement. One of the key problems is the temperature difference (td) between two ends of the nanowires. Only the td of 0.2 k was observed along a single wall carbon nanotube of 2 m. The beam of pb nanoclusters was generated by a gas aggregation cluster source and deposited onto the copper mesh. A tem of jeol 200cx was employed for the in situ observation and the process was recorded by a digital video system. The system was heated through a heating holder and the thermocouple sensor recorded the heating temperatures in a temperature - fixing mode. Fig. 2 shows the evidence of melting retardation of two particles, one of which is poc and the other is pos. No obvious signature of melting occurred in poc after 7 min of heating at 300 c. melting of pos occurred before 300 c . assuming the equivalence of the melting points of all the pb particles , the evidence with a td of more than 10 k is present along the cnw. A huge pb particle is attached on the cnw , leading to a much larger surface than the original cnw and a larger irradiation thermal dissipation. During heating from 673 to 723 k , the stable td is still smaller than 0.5 k when the diameter is equal to that of cnw. The evaporation of the pb core increases with increasing the heating temperature. The melting and the evaporation of the on cnw - pb particle are retarded by the confined thermal transportation along the cnw.

       " 'obesity increases the risk of heart failure ( hf)1 and cardiovascular death in the general population. A significant survival benefit of obesity in patients with established hf has been extensively described in different settings. Despite the potential benefits of weight loss ( wl ) in obese and overweight patients , this recommendation may not apply to patients with hf. Most patients were referred from cardiology and internal medicine departments. Less than 10% of patients were admitted to the hf unit due to asymptomatic , reduced lvef after acute myocardial infarction. All patients provided written consent for analytical samples and the use of their clinical data. All consecutive patients referred between august 1 , 2001 and september 30 , 2011 to a structured hf clinic at a university hospital were included in the study. Patients were classified according to bmi into 4 strata following the criteria defined by the world health organization ( who technical report series , no 854 , geneva , 1999 ) as follows: low weight ( bmi < 20.5  kg / m), normal weight (bmi 20.4  kg/ m), overweight, underweight and nonobese. All patients were referred from cardiology and internal medicine departments.  significant wl was defined as a loss of 5% from the initial weight ( ie , baseline ) to end of first year of followup. Patients were seen regularly during followup visits at the hf clinic according to their clinical needs. Less than one third of the patients in the present study actually participated in such an established program. Of 1322 patients admitted to the hf unit , a total of 1000 patients ( 72.7% men ; mean age 65.812.1  years ) were included in the study. 139 patients died during the first year of followup, 152 did not attend the 1year visit , and 31 had no weight available ( wheelchair or impossibility to stand up ) The patients were predominantly male , with a median duration of hf of 10.5  months ( q1q3 248  months ) , and a mean lvef of 32.412.6% . one hundred seventy patients ( 17% ) experienced significant wl during theFirst year ofFollowup. After 3 years of followup, 174 patients (17.4% ) died121 from cardiovascular causes, 54 worsening hf, 30 sudden death, 11 acute myocardial infarction, 5 stroke, and 21 other. mortality in significant wl patients was significantly higher than in patients withoutsignificant wl ( 27.6% versus 15.3% , p<0.001 ) among obese hf patients. Figures 1 and 2 show adjusted survival curves for allcause death relative to the presence or absence of significant wl for nonobese and obese patients. Figures 3 and 5 show cox regression multivariable analyses using standardized wl as continuous variable. Significant wl remained highly and independently associated with higher cardiovascular mortality ( p=0.003) among obese hf patients. The main conclusion of this study may seem perplexing, which is that significant wl might be not beneficial even in obese patients with hf. This finding may , in part , provide a rationale for the obesity paradox in hf , which is extensively described. purposeful wl is usually recommended for patients withHf and morbid obesity. Mariotti et  al evaluated the impact of a planned body weight reduction plan on quality of life and cardiac function in 34 obese and overweight chronic hf patients through a 6month nutritional and physical activity program. Those patients who achieved a loss of at least 3  kg ( about 3.2% of wl ) showed a significant improvement in lvef and mean nyha functional class.  significant wl was independently associated with mortality, with an increased risk of death of 20% ( gissihf ) to 150% ( valheft) in our study. Among obese patients ( bmi 30  kg / m ) , significant wL was associated with an even higher risk of. death ( 138% increase ) than in nonobese patients ( 83% increase) The present data are based on bmibased wl without further anthropometric characterization ( muscle or fat mass wasting assessments) We can not fully ascertain whether wl was in part intentional or nonintentional. studies are needed to ascertain whether this strategy might improve outcomes in obese patients with hf.  significant wl is just a marker of such a situation without playing a causative role. We have no data on what happened to weight during followup between year 1 and year 3 or the time of death. We can not disregard the possibility of bias due to selection of patients who may not necessarily represent the general hf population. weight loss of 5% during 1  year in ambulatory hf patients was associated with an ominous prognosis.',\n",

       " 'hepatitis c is a global health problem affecting over 170 - 200 million people and the virus is distributed worldwide with various prevalences from 0.2% to 40% in different countries. worldwide, 130 to 170 million people are infected with hepatitis c virus ( hcv) hcv is the most common cause of chronic liver disease and responsible for 8,000 - 12,000 deaths per year. Hepatitis c may account for 40% of all chronic liver diseases and 20% - 30% of liver transplants in iran. The burden of disease and death rate associated with hcv are expected to double over the next two decades. The current study aimed to assess the direct and indirect expenses of chronic hcv infection and its related diseases. The economic burden of illness for patients referred to medical centers was estimated in 2015. The economic burden of disease was estimated based on the prevalence with an emphasis on direct medical costs. Patients with chronic hcv , cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma were followed up for three months and the costs were estimated using a bottom - up approach. Total economic burden consisted of two parts , the direct economic burden ( medical costs and non - medical costs ) and the indirect costs during one year. With the use of economic resources of healthcare , direct medical costs could be measured including the average outpatient and inpatient costs. Annual outpatient or inpatient cost per patient was determined by the rate of visits and average cost of every visit. With respect to the indirect costs , the human capital approach was used ( 16 ) . This technique measures health by improving productivity and income ( especially through the reduction of work absenteeism and increased life expectancy ) Financial burden was calculated using the following formula: financial burden = total cost ( direct medical + direct non - medical + indirect costs )  estimated number of infected subjects in iran second. It was attempted to estimate the costs of treatments for patients with chc at different stages of the disease. The economic burden of disease was estimated based on the prevalence with an emphasis on direct medical costs. Patients with chronic hcv , cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma were followed up for three months and the costs were estimated using a bottom - up approach. Since major differences might exist between iran and other countries with respect to the costs and the patients social and economic status , specific cost information was evaluated. Cost data were collected via face - to- face or telephone interviews with the patients receiving inpatient and outpatient services from the mentioned treatment centers during the study period. The human capital approach was used to measure health by improving productivity and income ( especially through the reduction of work absenteeism and increased life expectancy ) Two types of financial burden were estimated for every stage of the disease. In the current study , 200 patients at different stages of the disease ( 166 patients with chronic hepatitis c infection , 24 with cirrhosis and 10 with hcc ) were enrolled respectively. Most of the direct costs of medical services were related to diagnostic costs. Hospitalization admission costs comprised a large portion of direct medical costs. The total cost of chronic hepatitis c infection for different stages of the disease among the active hepatitis c population and patients receiving treatment in the country was usd 6263.3. The estimated annual indirect costs for all stages of disease per patient with chronic hepatitisc infection were usd 1053.6. The ratio of direct to indirect costs increases with the progress of disease. The study found that chronic infection with hepatitis c and related diseases imposes great financial burden on the health system and society. The study was the first attempt to estimate the direct costs in iran and indirect costs in the terms of lost productivity or absence from work due to chronic hepatitis c infection, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatitis c imposes a heavy burden on the health system and used a large part of the resources to the health sector. early stage of the disease is less expensive for treatment but later stages and their complications are associated with higher treatment costs. in patients with chronic hepatitis c infection, nearly 68% of direct costs are allocated to medical diagnostic services ( such as laboratory tests , biopsy takings , ultrasonography , etc . ) , followed by the cost of drugs ( 16%) Almost all participants in more severe stages of the disease , including cirrhosis and hcc , said that the disease had imposed heavy financial burden on patients and their families. The problem was more significant for services not covered by insurance , such as certain medications or receiving services from nongovernmental centers. accurate data about the economic impact of hepatitis c infection is essential for health policy - makers with respect to prevention and treatment.',\n",

       " 'Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase ( ido) is an endogenous molecular mechanism that contributes to this immune regulation. ido is a major inhibitor of the effector phase of the immune response. It can suppress effector t cells directly by degradation of the essential amino acid tryptophan.  ido has a non - enzymic function that contributes to tgf- driven tolerance in non - inflammatory contexts. ido may contribute in a critical manner to inhibit or terminate inflammation and are highly overexpressed in cancer. In cancer patients, ido elevation occurs in a subset of plasmacytoid dc in tumor - draining lymph nodes. The immune system often fails to respond effectively and becomes tolerant toward immunogenic antigens. ido plays a critical role in the tolerance induction and immune suppression of anti - cancer immune responses. We sat out to determine if and how ido itself serve as target for specific t - cell responses , which may be exploited for immune therapy. We identified and characterized specific t cells spontaneously present among peripheral blood mononuclear cells.  ido driven immune suppression is a general mechanism that has been described in a variety of human cancers. ido is playing a crucial role in immune regulation and is inducible under normal physiological conditions. We found the apparent lack of tolerance against ido intriguing , since it suggested a more general role of ido - specific t cells in the regulation of the immune system. ido - specific t cells are able to boost specific immunity against virus or tumor antigens in human pbmc. ido expression is induced and ido - expressing apc inhibit further expansion of virus-specific t cells both directly and indirectly through activation of tregs. The addition of cytotoxic, ido-inducing mediators like ifn- and cpg odn generated measurable numbers of ido  t cells among pBMc.  ido expression contributes to the strength and duration of a given immune response due to its inflammation - induced counter - regulatory function. the addition of cytotoxic , ido - specific t cells ( tsup) removes immune suppressive cells from the pbmc culture thereby facilitating further expansion of virus -specific t cells. The function and potential role of the ido2-specific class - i - restricted lymphocytes present in peripheral blood still need to be resolved. ido is expressed at high levels in the gastrointestinal tract, although its precise role in intestinal immunity is not well understood. One could speculate that a fraction of the th17 that are highly prevalent at the mucosal tissues of healthy individuals is recognizing ido. Th17 cells might have a protective role in tumor immunopathology by promoting antitumor immunity. A large fraction of th17 cells produce high levels of effector cytokines such as il-2 , inf- as well as tnf. ido plays an important role in this conversion of foxp3 tregs to th17-like effector cells.  ido may exhibit its immune inhibitory functions both in the activation phases ( in the draining lymph node ) as well as in the effector phases ( at the site of the tumor ) ido is known to be induced by both type i and ii interferons, which are likely to be found at sites of immune activation and inflammation. The boosting of ido - specific immunity could have both direct and indirect effects. An ido based cancer vaccine might work directly at the tumor site by the attack of cancer cells as well as stromal cells. The circulation of a measurable number of ido - specific t cells did not seem to cause autoimmunity. The impressive clinical responses associated with adoptive transfer of til   urge that this strategy is pursued and investigated for the treatment of other cancer.  induction of ido immune - regulatory dendritic cells ( dc ) have been described to occur during infection of dcs with viruses and intracellular pathogens. ido may rather be involved in tolerance to non - self - antigens than self -antigens in situations where immune non - responsiveness may be important. targeting ido could have synergistic effects in anti - viral immune therapy , for example , in hepatitis b vaccines.  cmv has been shown to induce ido expression in monocytes. ido - specific t cells might function as support for the constitutive anti - cmv cd8 t - cell response. Counter - regulatory responses are important in the immune system as they help to limit the intensity and extent of immune responses. vaccine induced ido - specific t cells might kill ido suppressive antigen presenting cells ( apc ) as well as ido cancer cells. ido may exhibit its immune inhibitory functions both in the activation phases ( in the draining lymph node ) as wells as in the effector phases ( at the site of the tumor )  ido may rather be involved in tolerance to non - self - antigens than self. ido inhibition reduced local inflammation and parasite burdens in listeria monocytogenes infections. targeting of ido could have synergistic effects in anti - viral immune therapy , for example in hepatitis b vaccines. maniasis , and herpes simplex virus , the nature of this role that being antimicrobial or immunoregulatory might depend on the pathogen. this should naturally been taken into account when exploring the possible use of ido - specific t cells in the clinic. cmv is the most immune dominant antigen to be encountered by the human immune system.',\n",
       " ' fatigue in older adults is a strong predictor of functional limitations, disability, and mortality. Evidence suggests that oxidative stress and inflammation are associated with frailty. Leukocyte telomere length ( ltl) undergoes an accelerated shortening due to inflammation and increased oxidative stress. Ltl was measured using southern blots of the terminal restriction fragments after digestion with hphi and mnli restriction enzymes. fatigue was measured by the mob - t scale based on questions about six mobility items. Each activity was described relative to whether the respondents did or did not feel fatigued afterwards. Lifestyle, mental health, and aging - related somatic diseases were included as potential confounding factors. physical activity was scored on a five - point scale deducted from self - reported level and frequency of physical activity. cognitive performance was scored by a cognitive composite score. depression symptomatology was assessed using an adaptation of the depression section of the cambridge mental disorders of the elderly examination. A total of 439 twins representing 257 twin pairs were studied. The mean ages of the participants were 78.1 years for men and 78.5 years for women. Women were found to have longer ltl than men. fatigue was inversely correlated with age ( r = 0.25 , p < 0.001) For every one unit change in fatigue score, ltl differed by 0.039  kb ( p = 0.054 ) within the pair. The effect was not significantly different between mz and dz twin pairs. The association was attenuated when including lifestyle factors. The present study shows that ltl is associated with fatigue before the onset of disablement. We found no influence of either diseases or cognitive function on the ltl - fatigue association. of the included lifestyle factors , we found that only smoking had a slight effect on the association between ltl and fatigue. Study suggests a possible common physiological pathway between ltl attrition and fatigue. Future studies should examine changes over time of ltl and fatigue score in the same individuals. The findings are suggestive of oxidative stress and inflammation being underlying factors of fatigue. These findings should spur the search for more biomarkers leading to a better understanding of the physiology behind fatigue.',\n",

The right eye examination revealed blepharospasm , significant lid edema , hyperhemic conjunctiva , and a mobile living whitish organic foreign body in the anterior chamber. The surgical intervention consisted of a limbal - based incision between 11 and 13 oclock , expulsion of the worm anterior chamber , washout followed by a capsulotomy releasing of synechia in 360. The baby was infected with loa loa at 2 months of age. The case was similar to the first case described in cameroon by lucot and chovet ( 1972 ) in which the baby was 14 months old. Despite negative parasitemia the follow - up was good although the cornea remained slightly troubled at the end of the treatment. Uveitis with hypopion and secondary cataract with corneal oedema were the anatomic complications of our case. Despite negative parasitemia , we decided to treat with dec like many other clinicians. This was justified by the hyperendemicity of loiasis in the region. loiasis is very common in the rain forest of central and west africa.',\n",

       " \"hyperkyphosis or increase in thoracic curve greater than normal range is one of prevalent spinal disorders. An increase in kyphosis may be associated with significantly higher spinal loads and trunk muscle force in upright stance. This might accelerate degenerative process which in turn leads to further spinal dysfunction and pain. 582 subjects were chosen across male students aged 13 to 18 years living in kermanshah. exclusion criteria were having neuromuscular disorders, scoliosis , history of surgery , or any diseases on spinal column. Participants were asked about history and sign of spinal surgery. For measuring the kyphosis , students were asked to stand comfortable and look forward in a way that body weight would be divided equally. The least thoracic angle was 12.05 observed in students who were 13 years old and the biggest was 68.84 in those who were 16 years old. The biggest magnitude of mean curve was seen in 16-year - old age group that may be due to pubertal growth. Radiography ( cobb method ) is the most commonly used method to assess sagittal spinal curves. Some studies using radiography including takemitsu and harada reported 37 for mean thoracic kyphosis. The age for this decrease in each research was different which can be due to natural differences in subjects. Thorasic kyphosis was evaluated from sagittal radiography of the thoracic column using cobb 's method and by means of the flexicurve method. The values driven by radiographic method are obviously more than those taken by noninvasive methods. A norm was established for male students aged 13 to 18 years old which can be used as normal values for local and regional purposes.\",\n",
       " 'efficient delivery of drugs to their targets can significantly improve their therapeutic potency. Drug delivery systems (ddss) have been introduced as novel tools to improve the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics properties of drugs. A wide range of ddss were constructed recently from different materials including polymers, peptides, and liposomes. Senps have been coated or functionalized with other compounds to improve their biological profile. The size of nanoparticles is a critical element that can alter their biological properties. The surface functionalization of spherical senps with 5-fluorouracil through physical adsorption increased the uptake of the senps by cells. To improve the cellular uptake of senps , their surface has been decorated by various ligands. The design and synthesis of homochiral l - cyclic peptides and their application for the nuclear targeting delivery of anti - hiv drugs and biomolecules have been reported by us. We report here synthesis and evaluation of a cyclic cell - penetrating peptide composed of ten amino acids including arginine , tryptophan ,  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 and cysteine. The ability of the peptide for in situ  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 synthesis of peptide - capped selenium nanoparticles was investigated. uronium  hexafluorophosphate ( hbtu ) and n , n - diisopropylethylamine ( dipea ) were added to anhydrous n - dimethylformamide ( dmf ) The fmoc group  was deprotected using piperidine in dmF ( 20% v / v ) The protected peptide was then cleaved from the resin by agitating the resin with a cleavage cocktail. The cyclic peptide was precipitated with diethyl ether followed by centrifugation to provide solid crude cyclized peptide. It was purified using reverse phase chromatography using a hitachi lachrom elite reversed - phase high - performance liquid chromatograph. The purity of the final product ( 95% ) was confirmed by analytical rp - hplc.  synthesizing senps was carried out by reacting the selenium solution with the cyclic peptide. The drug was conjugated through using a glycine linker as elaborated in the supporting information. ovarian adenocarcinoma ( sk - ov-3), human leukemia ( ccrf - cem), and human embryonic kidney epithelial ( hek-293 t) cells were used. The cytotoxicity assay was performed by using sk - ov-3 ( 5000 ) , hek-293 t ( 4000 ) , and ccrf - cem ( 40  000 ) cells based on our reported procedure. antiproliferative activities of several anticancer drugs including gemcitabine, epirubicin, dasatinib, etoposide, paclitaxel and clofarabine were evaluated. The results were compared with those of drugs alone after 48 h. Dox intracellular release was investigated by using an hplc technique as described previously. The cyclic decapeptide [ w5r4c ] was synthesized by employing fmoc / tbu - based solid phase chemistry. The side chain of protected peptide was deprotected by using cleavage cocktail followed by reverse phase hPLc purification. A one - pot reaction without any surface functionalization of senps is a one- pot reaction. tryptophan ( w ) is known to have the most efficient reducing capability compared to the other 19 amino acids. positively charged arginine ( r ) residues enhanced the reducing activity of the peptide via the appropriate ionic interactions with the negatively charged selenite anions. cysteine facilitated the formation of the formed nanoparticles possibly through stabilizing them. Both covalent and noncovalent interactions were assumed to be involved. The shape of [ w5r4c]senps was changed to multilayer ball - shape nanoparticles. The size range of nanoparticles was increased after incubation with dox to 250270 nm. This suggests the surface capping of senps by peptides or interactions withDox. Cpt ( 5:1) showed a blue shift with a maxima at 209 nm. This suggests significant interaction of cpt with peptide - capped metal nanoparticles. We postulate that this is because of the self - quenching of bounded compound and the distribution and entrapment in the hydrophobic region formed by the cyclic peptide  senps. itionally of 500 m ) to maintain a 1 to 10 molar ratio. [ w5r4c]senps ( 50 m ) did not exhibit significant toxicity after 2 h in human ovarian adenocarcinoma ( sk - ov-3 ) and human embryonic kidney 293 ( hek-293 t ) cells. F-das ( 5 m ) intracellular uptake was evaluated by a flow cytometry technique. Flow cytometry results indicated that cells incubated with f-drug mixed with [ w5r4c]senps ( 50 m) had notably higher fluorescence intensity compared to that in cells treated with f -das alone. The data reveal that both the peptide and senps in [ w 5r4C]senPS contribute to the improvement of the cellular uptake of the drug in a higher degree. Senps were examined for transporting a relatively large negatively charged phosphopeptide with limited cellular permeability. [ w5r4c]senps increased the f-pepylgld uptake by 1.4-fold when compared to that of [ w 5r4C ] ( figure 8) These data propose that senps have a significant effect on enhancing the cellular uptake of the phosphopepticide. No green fluorescence  was seen in cells when they were incubated with f-pepylgld ( 5 m) alone. This suggests that the phosphopeptide alone could not cross the cellular membrane. When [ w5r4c]senps were used a significantly higher fluorescence intensity was observed. The uptake of f-pepylgld - loaded [ w5r4c]senps was inhibited by 52% and 40% when nystatin and eia were used. These data suggest that clathrin - mediated or caveolae - mediated endocytosis and phagocytotic pathways are not the only mechanisms of cellular uptake. The surface decoration of senps by the peptide structure can improve nanoparticle stability and influence the cellular uptake mechanism. A hplc technique was used to investigate the intracellular release of dox by [ w5r4c]senps  dox complex. ccrf  cem cells ( 1.2  10 ) were incubated with  w5R4csenps ( 50 m) loaded with dox ( 5 m) for various times ( 1248  h ) The quantity of the released dox was calculated by analyzing hPLc data at 490 nm after different time intervals. The data showed that dox releases dox following a time - dependent pattern. The degradation of the peptide - capped senps complex could generate aggregated toxic selenium leading to the synergistic effect in cancer cells. The antiproliferative results showed the sustained release of drugs in cells in a time - dependent pattern in sk - ov-3 cells.',\n",
       " \"Mitochondria are very efficient machines for decoding intracellular signals and in particular the calcium ( ca ) one ( clapham , 2007 ) The mitochondrial respiratory chain, by pumping protons across the ion - impermeable inner membrane, establishes a gradient. This implies a strong thermodynamic force in favor of the accumulation of cations. ca import across the outer mitochondrial membrane ( omm ) occurs through the voltage - dependent anion channels ( vdac) The identity of the mcu, as the product of the ccdc109a gene, has recently been reported. The role for these proteins is still controversial and further work will be needed. The effect of letm1 down - regulation / over - expression on mitochondrial ca transport could be a secondary effect of a decreased k / h exchange activity.  mitochondrial ca homeostasis remains elusive. A ca signal originating in the cytoplasm that is propagated to mitochondria permits the transmission of an activatory signal to the energy powerhouse of the cell. The alteration of the ca signals that reach mitochondria in association with different pathological conditions ( e.g. oxidative stress) can induce a profound alteration of organelle structure and function.  mitochondria are considered the major source of ros and the extent of oxidative damage to macromolecules is generally thought to be the random consequence of physiological functions. Recent findings suggest that these phenomena are genetically determined at least in part and biochemically controlled by a stress - induced signal transduction pathway involving the 66-kda isoform of shc , p66shc. In order to exert its functions, p66shc has to be phosphorylated at serine 36. The phosphorylation of ser36 induces translocation to mitochondria. The signaling pathway involving pkc, pin1 and pp2a controls the mitochondrial import of p66Shc.  mitochondrial impairment has also been associated with the pathogenesis of some neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disorders. Many lines of evidence suggest that both mitochondrial dna mutations and increased oxidative stress are major contributors in aging. It has been demonstrated in many of the most frequently occurring diseases that mitochondria interact with proteins crucial to the development the pathology. In these interactions , ca homeostasis often plays a key role (see fig .  2 ) . this brings hope for effective therapies that target mitochondrial processes and interaction sites of mitochondria and disease - related proteins. Parkinson 's disease ( pd) is caused by widespread neurodegeneration in the brain. Several preliminary trials of l - type ca and nmdar channel blockers have been carried out with some success. Trpc1 could also be neuroprotective against pd - inducing agents. Possible links between mitochondrial dysfunctions and changes in ca homeostasis and hd pathology have been reviewed.  mitochondrial diseases ( mids) predominantly manifest themselves in tissue / organs with high - energy requirements. Mids are mainly due to mutations in mitochondrial or nuclear dna ( mtdna and ndna ) resulting in the altered function of the respiratory chain or oxidative phosphorylation ( oxphos) The mitochondrial genome possesses a very high mutation rate , 10- to 17-fold higher than that observed in nDna. isystemic disease , and neurodegenerative diseases , including pd , ad and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The general objective is to increase mitochondrial atp production and to slow ( or arrest ) the progression of the clinical symptoms. In order to correct the energy imbalance in mids , it would be interesting to introduce drugs able to act on intracellular ca homeostasis.  mitochondrial ca uptake is also a signaling event in the apoptotic cascade. oxidative stress appears to be a common feature in many mids. Therapeutic approaches based on ca handling should be considered together with antioxidant drugs or blockers of the ptp. cyclosporin a ( csa) is able to inhibit cytochrome c release induced by a number of apoptotic stimuli. Ru360 treatment dramatically decreased [ ca]m and inhibited ptp opening. This was associated with improved recovery of heart performance. mitochondrial membrane potential is another critical regulator of ca accumulation. depolarization reduces the driving force for ca uptake by mitochondria. This prompted researchers to consider the decrease of potential as a possible mechanism of cellular protection. The use of novel mitochondria - targeted antioxidants has gained much interest. mitoq, based on the mitochondrial ubiquinone coenzyme q, is such a compound. A recent study demonstrated that feeding rats with mitoqu significantly limited cardiac reperfusion injury. A new mitochondrial - targeted cardioprotective drug, tro40303 (3,5-seco-4-nor - cholestan-5-one oxime-3-ol ) has been discovered. Tro40303 binds specifically to the mitochondrial translocator protein and inhibits ptp opening triggered by oxidative stress. The bcl-2 family proteins control mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and ca homeostasis. They also play a central role in regulating apoptosis in the cardiovascular system.  mitochondria are an integral part of the insulin system found in the islet cells of the pancreas. It is still difficult ( and controversial ) to establish whether the alterations in mitochondrial function are the cause or the effect of the disease. mitochondria take up ca through the mitochondrial ca uniporter in response to the glucose - induced rise in cytoplasmic ca. The diabetic state is related to mitochondrial dysfunction and generally characterized by insufficient supply of energy or defects in the insulin signaling pathway. A reduction in mitochondrial ca accumulation is responsible for a reduction in insulin secretion. The signaling mechanisms that decode changes in nutrient supply are complex and not completely understood. A control in intracellular [ ca ] at the mitochondrial level appears to be of great significance for further research. Biochemically designed therapeutic approaches in the treatment of several disorders. being developed.

       " 'The group - additive model was a pragmatic first step to understand the hydration thermodynamics of a complicated macromolecule. It is also important to assess  its limitations and probe if the physical conclusions based on this approach are valid. The group- additive model appears to capture the effect of osmolytes on protein unfolding. olytes rather well , with the predicted and experimentally determined m values agreeing to within a couple kilocalories per mole for proteins with about 100 residues. On this basis , it has been suggested that some osmolytes largely act by tuning the solubility of the peptide  backbone. We study the conditional solvation of an isoleucine residue, often regarded as very hydrophobic. We use  the quasichemical approach to separate the packing ( steric )  contributions from the hydrophilic contributions to both facilitate the calculation and also provide insights into the limitations of additivity. These components do depend on the specification of a hydration shell, but the approach has nevertheless provided important insights into  physics of hydration and in generating models of molecular solutions. The quasichemical approach leads to free energies in good agreement with traditional free - energy perturbation or histogram approaches, with the added advantages of the physical insights provided by the approach. The excess entropy of hydration of the solute is given approximately by4. The average solute solvent interaction contribution is esw and the average solvent reorganization contribution is ereorg. The pentapeptides ggggg , ggigg , and igggg are modeled in the extended  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 configuration with the long axis aligned with the diagonal of the simulation cell. helical deca - glycine ( g9 g ) and a9 g a helical peptide with nine alanine and one glycine at position 6 (a9 g) serve as references. all peptides had an acetylated  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 ( ace ) n - terminus and an n - methyl - amide ( nme ) c -terminus. the lennard - jones parameters for the isoleucine side chain were used for g - butane. The internal conformation of the isoleucine is the same in g - butane , ggigg and the helical peptides. The free - energy calculations and error analysis follow the procedure previously described. For the extended peptides, the long - range contribution was obtained by performing particle - insertion calculations in the appropriate molecular - shaped cavity. Excess energy was obtained by adapting the shell - wise calculation  procedure previously used for studying the hydration of methane. We use the quasichemical approach to study the packing, chemistry and long - range contributions of the side chain in the presence of the reference. We open a cavity at the appropriate position next to mh to accommodate the sideChain. We expel solvent only around the side Chain x in mx with solvent excluded. In additivity - based approaches , a protein is partitioned down to single peptide units ( or even lower ) and the thermodynamics of the macromolecule is obtained using equations. Here we partition the helical peptide s into just two groups , the isoleucine side chain ( sc ) and  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 the rest , generically termed the background ( back ) ; then5where sc - modelex refers to the conditional hydration contribution of the side chain in a model compound. Energy of the isoleucine side chain  is in good agreement with the excess free energy of g - butane. comparing the discharged and charged analogs of the amino  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 acids shows that slightly over half of the 2.5 kcal / mol free energy comes from differences in the free energy. This is suggestive of screening of the zwitterion - dipole by the side  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 chain. Table 3 summarizes the results on the conditional hydration of isoleucine in the helical peptides g9i and a9i. Once again, we find large deviations between the conditional contribution  and the value from the side - chain model appropriately scaled by the  southeastern solvent exposure. The fractional solvent exposure of  isoleUCine in g9I is 0.59 , and in a9I it is sc = 0.56 . relative to isole UCine in  ggigg , sc =  0.95 ( g91 ) and sc =0.90 ( a9 i ) The conditional contribution of amino acid x from a small - length - scale model or side - chain analog is of limited utility in modeling the contribution of x in model helices. We look at two interrelated aspects of the problem : ( 1)  hydration of the side chain in the presence of the background and ( 2) how this compares with the side -Chain analog. Grafting a g - butane onto a zwitterionic glycine causes an unfavorable change in esw. The side chain contributes 8.1 kcal / mol for a net change of 1.8 kcal. The effects of this problem are seen to varying extents in the other peptide systems studied here. Using y[gxg]y[ggg ] to model y[x ] in proteins has important limitations. No single scaling factor proves to be satisfactory in capturing both the hydrophilic and hydrophobic aspects of hydration , especially if one uses the stringent precision levels suggested by dill. The derived conditional energetics of the side chain are seen to contain nonobvious contributions from the changes in the hydration of the background. The identification of greater or lesser hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity will itself be context - dependent. This could be of concern in assessing  contributions of hydrophilic versus hydrophobic mutations in proteins. The successes in using small - molecule data in modeling protein hydration should be considered with respect to the errors required in a given context.',\n",

       " 'trypanosoma brucei is the causative agent of both human african trypanosomiasis ( hat , or sleeping sickness ) and the livestock disease , nagana. over 50,000 people throughout 36 countries in sub - saharan africa are currently estimated to be infected. The current drug treatments for the later stage of the disease are difficult to administer and have associated toxicity. Stumpy forms are cell cycle - arrested and have elaborated mitochondrial activity. upon uptake in a tsetse blood - meal, stumpy forms differentiate into the proliferative procyclic forms in response to cold shock. The proliferation of slender forms contributes to the establishment of parasite numbers in the blood and, through antigen variation, to immune evasion. In contrast, the irreversible division - arrest of stumpy Form acts to control the expansion of parasite Numbers in the mammalian bloodstream. The balance between slender and stumpy forms in mammalian hosts plays a pivotal role in trypanosome infection and transmission. understanding the molecular events implicit in the slender to stumpy form transition and their subsequent differentiation to tsetse midgut forms ( procyclic forms) is of interest and importance, though poorly understood. The molecular mechanism by which bloodstream trypanosomes perceive their change in environment and initiate differentiation to procyclic forms once in the tsetse fly has been elusive, until recently. It has long been known that the use of high concentrations ( > 3 mm ) of citrate or cis - aconitate ( cca ) could induce differentiation of bloodstream form trypanoomes to pro cyclic forms in vitro. The biological relevance of this signal was in doubt as these levels exceed the concentrations of cca that a try panosome would be exposed to in the Tsetse midgut. A drop in temperature from 37c to 20c could significantly increase try Panosomes sensitivity to cca.  differential expression and localisation of the pad proteins provide two levels of control during the differentiation to procyclic forms. This ensures that only the transmissible stumpy forms are able to detect the differentiation signal. As citrate is present in blood at 130 m, this secondary control point could be crucial to prevent premature differentiation. The discovery of the pad proteins provides the first molecular insight into the environmental sensing mechanisms used by the stumpy form to perceive transmission and so initiate differentiation. trypanosomes differentiate between distinct life stages in order to prepare for and adapt to the different environments they encounter during their life cycle. during the bloodstream stage of the life cycle, try panosomes exist as either proliferative  slender forms or non - proliferative , transmissible , stumpy forms. the proportion of these types changes during the course of infection , this apparently being governed by the density of parasites in the blood. the bloodstream trypano population is adapted to promote parasite maintenance in the mammalian blood and transmission to tsetse flies. Stumpy forms are cell cycle - arrested and have elaborated mitochondrial activity. upon uptake in a tsetse blood - meal, stumpy forms differentiate into the proliferative procyclic forms in response to cold shock. understanding the molecular events implicit in the slender to stumpy form transition is of interest and importance , though poorly understood.  cytological evidence based on in vitro differentiation experiments suggests that bloodstream forms can only transform to procyclic forms from a given point in the cell cycle. Stumpy forms are uniformly arrested as a population in g0/g1 and can accumulate to near homogeneity in experimental infections. This allows for their efficient and synchronous differentiation to pro cyclic forms. In 2004, engstler and boshart discovered that a drop in temperature from 37c to 20c could significantly increase trypanosome sensitivity to cca. The molecular basis of this model was unknown until a gene family encoding surface carboxylate transporters known as pad proteins was recently identified. Two of the encoded pad proteins ( pad1 and pad2 ) were shown to be expressed in stumpy forms but not in slender forms and were found to be required for perception of cca at physiological concentrations. A summary of the expression of pad proteins and the consequences for trypanosome differentiation events. citrate is present in blood at 130  m , this secondary control point could be crucial to prevent premature differentiation to procyclic forms whilst within the host. This signal only being detected upon temperature reduction in the tsetse blood - meal. pad protein expression and localisation act as checkpoints for differentiation. The discovery of the pad proteins provides the first molecular insight into the environmental sensing mechanisms used by the stumpy form to perceive transmission and so initiate differentiation. differentiation between life cycle stages and the progression of the cell cycle are intimately linked in trypanosomes. With the identification of pad1 as a surface molecule that identifies cells that are functionally competent for transmission , as well as developments in parasite culture and transfection , the route has been opened up to dissect the biology of the parasite.  pad1 is a molecular marker for stumpy forms. It enables the events of cell cycle exit and stumpy formation to be tracked at the level of an individual cell. This provides a temporal map of the steps leading to transmission competence. The identity of sif and the molecular mechanisms of its reception are currently unknown.  accelerated parasite development has the potential to reduce host parasitaemia , but also to increase the transmission potential of the population. The extent of this risk depends on several factors : the density of parasites in the bloodstream, the number of parasites required to infect a tsetse fly and the efficiency of accelerated development. If stumpy formation could be driven to 100% efficiency , then the irreversible division - arrest of these forms would ensure complete parasite elimination through cell senescence within only a few days. Stumpy forms are cell cycle - arrested in g0/g1 but derived from proliferative slender forms. This transition requires exit from the cell cycle , morphological change and stumpy - specific gene expression. The discovery of pad1 as a molecular marker for stumpy forms enables the events of cell cycle exit and stumpy formation to be tracked at the level of an individual cell. The production of stumpy forms is a key contributor to the ordered expression of distinct antigenic variants that sustain chronic trypanosome infections. The identification of a molecular marker that distinguishes the non - proliferative stumpy form provides the ability to develop high - throughput screens for compounds that accelerate stumpy formation at abnormally low parasite density. The identification of stumpy marker proteins such as pad offers the ability to screen for new drugs to accelerate stumpy formation and to refine the transmission models required to optimise their potential deployment in the field. The ability of pad proteins to discriminate stumpy forms enables high - throughput screens for compounds that accelerate Stumpy formation at low parasite density.',\n",
       " 'an increasing body of evidence suggests that retinal neurodegeneration and inflammation occur in human diabetes even before the development of clinical signs of diabetic retinopathy ( dr ) retinal microglia activation has been recognized as the main responsible for the initial inflammatory response. spectral domain optical coherence tomography has become a valuable tool for the in vivo evaluation of single retinal layers in diabetic patients. The main purpose of this study was to determine the presence and location of hyperreflective spots in the retina in diabetic patients without dr or with early stages of dr. 36 subjects were included in the study. The exclusion criteria were proliferative dr, macular edema, any type of previous retinal treatment ( macular laser photocoagulation , vitrectomy , intravitreal steroids , and/or antiangiogenic drugs ) and significant media opacities that precluded fundus imaging.  hyperreflective spots were significantly more numerous in the inner retina of diabetics and completely absent in the outer retina of controls. The intraobserver and interobserver agreement was almost perfect (  > 0.9 ) for all measurements. mean diabetes duration was 10.2  4 years. and 59.3  11.2 years in nonproliferative dr ( npdr) Small, punctiform hyperreflective elements scattered throughout all retina layers. mainly located in the outer retina layers around fluid accumulation in the intraretinal cystoid spaces in age related macular degeneration. After anti - vegf treatment, the hrs were the first features to disappear or to reduce significantly. Microglial cells undergo significant changes as the shape and size of individual cells are concerned and aggregate among them to form the microglial aggregates. Neither of the patients included in this study had macular edema , hard exudates , or subclinical ( oct ) signs of dme. hyperreflective spots may correspond to aggregates of microglia activated cells, as reported in other retinal diseases. The number of sd - oct hyperreflectives spots increases with the clinical progression of dr. A prospective study on the evolution of dr and hrs location and presence is currently underway in order to strengthen our hypothesis.',\n",
       " 'macroautophagy is a highly conserved catabolic process in which cytoplasmic proteins and organelles are engulfed by double - membrane structures. autophagosomes are formed by the elongation and fusion of cup - shaped structures called phagophores. The origin of the autphagosome membranes has been a major question in the field. Autophagosomes appear to be formed at the endoplasmic reticulum ( er) via structures called omegasomes. plasma membrane contributes to nascent autophagosome formation under both basal and autophagy induction conditions. matg9 is the only known multipass transmembrane protein that is necessary for optimalautophagy. in yeast and in mammalian cells, matg 9 has been associated with the golgi apparatus.  matg9 interactions with omegasomes and autophagosomes have been examined using live - cell imaging and fusion events were not observed. We find that matg 9 vesicles are trafficked from the plasma membrane to the recycling endosome via clathrin - coated pits. We found that atg16l1 was also present in the recycling compartment and participates in vesicle fusions withMatg9-postive ves particles in that site.  transferrin and its cognate receptor are internalized by clathrin - mediated endocytosis and recycled back to the plasma membrane through early endosomes. At steady state, recycling endosome are the predominant intracellular site at which one sees the transferrin receptor ( tfr ) , as well as its ligand transferrin. We examined whether matg9 is trafficked to the plasma membrane and then internalized by clathrin - mediated endocytosis. We showed that almost noClathrin labeling was observed in cells transfected and labeled with gFP ( figure  s1h ) in addition to clathin - coated structures , em also revealed matg 9 associated with plasma membrane, endocytic structures, autophagic structures , and golgi. Matg9 and atg16l1 appeared to associate with two different pools of clathrin - coated structures. matg9 was associated with eea1-positive early endosomes, whereas atg 16l1 was not seen with this type of endosome. Matg9 vesicles appear to arrive at recyclingendosomes via endocytosis. Atg16L1- positive tubulovesicular structures ( probably phagophore precursors ) localizing close to the golgi. The atg16l1 tubulovesicular structures appear to be distinct from the golgi. We tested whether atg 16l1 trafficked through recycling endosomes. Homotypic fusion of vesicles is an important step that increases the size of these structures. The recycling compartment may provide membranes to preautophagosomal structures. The colocalization of matg9 and atg16l1 in the recycling endosomes raised the possibility that these fusion events may be occurring in that compartment. The temperature block ( 18c) that inhibits membrane traffic between early and recycling endoomes also clearly impairs autophagosome formation as measured on lc3-ii blots.  decreased temperature block decreased the extent to which atg16l1 and matg9 colocalized and decreased the sizes of both matg 9 and atg 16l1 vesicles. This suggests that this treatment impaired homotypic and heterotypic fusion of atg15l1 & Matg9. Both rab11 and myosin vb tail overexpression enhanced autophagosome formation.  starvation decreased transferrin recycling. starvation increased atg16l1 vesicle interactions in real time. These data suggest that matg9 vesicles likely travel from early endosomes to recycling endosome where they meet atg 16l1-containing ves particles. The fusion of these veicles appears to be rate limiting for autophagosome formation.  vamp3 knockdown resulted in the strongest elevation of p62 levels ( figure  5a ) . we confirmed that vam3 indeed regulated autophagy by showing that it decreased autophagosome numbers ( lc3-ii levels on western blots versus actin and a 60% reduction in the number of lC3-positive vesicles [ autophagousomes ] ) Vamp3 localizes in early endosomes ( eea1 positive ) and recycling endosome ( rab11 positive ) as described previously. A temperature block at 18c did not affect the colocalization between matg9 and vamp 3 , suggesting that the two proteins are cotrafficking.  knockdown of vamp3 caused the accumulation of atg16l1 in recycling endosomes but did not lead to a change in its abundance in early endosome. matg9 was previously found to have less colocalization with autophagic markers than with other organelles. This observation could be interpreted as suggesting that matg 9 has a complex itinerary and that it fuses with  autophagosomes. Our data suggest that matg9 does indeed follow a complex itinerary and also becomes associated with nascent autophagosomes. because matg 9 is a transmembrane protein , it is likely that it is incorporated with some membrane from its originating compartment. Although both proteins end up in recycling endosomes ,matg9 is trafficked to recycling endo-endosomes via eea1-positive early endosome.  vamp3 appears to colocalize first with matg9 in early endosomes and then likely fuses with partner snares on atg16l1 in recycling endosome - associated structures. this model is consistent with our observations with the 18c temperature block, which inhibits membrane trafficking. Vamp3 knockdown has no obvious effect on transferrin recycling. ocytic trafficking or that vamp3 may be mediating selective fusion of components of the early endosomal and recycling endosome compartments rather than bulk fusion. The relevant partner , q - snares , regulating this event will need to be elucidated in future studies. Hela cells were seeded on mattek petri dish ( mattek) at a density of 1.5   10 cells per dish. Cells were placed in hbss ( ca mg ) with hepes , after which they were imaged immediately at 37c.

       " 'There has been a worldwide increase in the incidence of papillary thyroid carcinoma ( ptc) The reason for this increase is not well understood. The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze a series of thyroidectomies performed at our center over the course of a decade ( 2001 - 2010 ) A total of 1,263 cases , 1,023 women and 240 men ( average age of 51.9 years ) were included retrospectively. thyroidectomy was prescribed for malignancy or suspicious of malignancies in 221 patients ( 17.5% ) The mean size of the ptc was 15.4 ( 12.6 ) mm , and no significant differences in size were observed over the 10 years. There was an increase in the number of total thyroidectomies in the second half of the decade. The percentage of ptc increased by almost 10% between 2006 and 2010 compared to 2001 and 2005. The screening effect is the higher and better performance of various tests in the general population, such as us and fnabs of thyroid nodules. It has been hypothesized that if the entire pool of occult ptc were identified antemorten , the resulting ascertainment bias could result in a 50-fold increase in the apparent incidence of ptc. In our study , we did not observe an increase in microcarcinomas , and the average size of pTC did not change over the decade. Although it is postulated as being more frequent , not all reports found that the increase in ptc was only at the expense of smaller ptcs. The study population is not representative of the general population nor is it a population with thyroid disease. We can not rule out bias caused by changes in social or demographic parameters in the reference population. The relatively short study period also reduced the likelihood of changes in socio - demographic status, referral criteria, surgical indications and diagnostic ( clinical and histological ) and therapeutic protocols.',\n",
       " 'ten subjects with type 2 diabetes and 10 age - matched healthy control subjects participated. Patients continued their usual medication because antidiabetic , antihypertensive , and lipid - lowering drugs exhibit long - term effects without acute affection of cardiovascular regulation. Patients with nephropathy or history of angina were excluded. Adenosine ( 18.7 mol / ml ; item development ab , stockholm , sweden ) was infused at rates of 0.8 in control subjects and 1.1 mol / min in patients ( p = 0.38 ) , whereas atp ( 1 mol /ml , sigma a7699 ; sigma - aldrich co. , st . louis , mo ) was infusion at 0.9 and 0.6 mol /min, respectively, to increase blood flow to target lbf ( 2.8 l / min ) The vasoconstrictor effect of tyramine, which evokes endogenous noradrenaline ( na ) release from sympathetic nerve endings and subsequent postjunctional - The vasodilatory potency of adenosine and atp was similar in control subjects and patients ( 309  54 vs. 250  81 ml/mol atpkg [ p = 0.48 ] and 13.3  1.7 vs. 12.5  4ml/mol adenosinesinekg [ p=0.38 ] ) During adenosin and atP infusions, lbf increased ninefold in both control subjects. Coinfusion with tyramine during atp infusion reduced lbf ( from 2.9  0.2 to 2.0 0.2 l / min in patients)  o2 content did not differ at baseline ( 92  7 in control subjects vs. 77  9 ml / l in patients ) or during the different interventions. during exercise , the arteriovenous difference increased similarly ( 130  6ml / l ) and coinfusion with tyramine did not alter the values. heart rate at baseline tended to be higher in patients ( 68  4 bpm in patients) but during the interventions ,  values were similar. cardiac output increased more in the group with diabetes during adenosine infusion. The vasodilatory potency of adenosine and atp was similar in control subjects and patients ( 309  54 vs. 250  81 ml/mol atpkg [ p = 0.48 ] and 13.3  1.7 vs. 12.5  4ml/mol adenosinesinekg [ p > 0.38 ] ) During tyramine coinfusion, venous na did not change in the two groups. However, during atp infusion, na increased in the control group. This difference was also reflected during combined atp and tyamine infusions.  map at baseline was slightly higher in the control group , yet not significant and potentially reflecting antihypertensive treatment in the group with diabetes. map increased from baseline ( 101  4 in control subjects vs. 94  4 mmhg in patients ) to similar values during exercise. during adenosine infusion , map was unaltered , but during coinfusion with tyramine , map increased in both groups to 107  3mmhg. There were no differences in o2 delivery or uptake during the infusions of adenosine, atp , exercise , or coinfusion of tyramine. heart rate at baseline tended to be higher in patients than in control subjects. cardiac output increased more in the group with diabetes during adenosines infusion. The main findings of the current study are that patients with type 2 diabetes and intact endothelial function have a similar capacity to blunt sympathetic vasoconstriction during moderate exercise as healthy age- and bmi - matched control subjects. The subjects with diabetes had a lower venous content of na but a similar elevation of venous na during the adenosine infusions, exercise , and tyramine interventions. Luminal atp was shown to abolish tyramine - induced sympathetic vasoconstriction in young subjects. Atp is contributing to functional sympatholysis via activation of the p2y2 receptor ( 6 ) in contrast with this finding , both groups in the current study had a reduction in lbf during combined atp and tyramina infusion. The sympatholytic effect of atp is graded and dose - dependent.  decline in lbf responses to atp and adenosine may reflect age - related changes of the signaling pathways. Physical inactivity and obesity also affect endothelial function and cardiovascular regulation. Despite increases in sympathetic nerve activity in patients with diabetes , plasma na level has been found to be reduced compared with control subjects.  circulating atp mimics exercise hyperemia by its vasodilatory potency and by increasing msna and circulating na. Differences are a result of antidiabetic treatment or a physiologic response to elevation in sympathetic nerve activity. No truly selective human antagonists and ligands of p2 receptors are currently available. Aging is associated with a greater vasoconstrictor tone in active muscles during exercise compared with young adults. The ability of functional sympatholysis during moderate exercise was not reduced in the group with diabetes. This may be clinically relevant given that pathology, affecting the vasodilatory function, could be expected to limit skeletal muscle blood flow. There were no changes in lvc or lbf during exercise with coinfusion of tyramine. functional sympatholysis in middle - aged persons could gradually be more dependent on factors other than atp. The amount of atp and adenosine needed to increase lbf to levels matching exercise was similar in the two groups. Plasma na was found to be reduced in patients with diabetes compared with control subjects. Plasma na elevation may not be a precise measure of the effect on msna. circulating atp mimics exercise hyperemia by its vasodilatory potency and by increasing msna and circulating na. No truly selective human antagonists and ligands of p2 receptors are currently available. The present measurements of venous na may reflect interstitial conditions. attenuation of purinergic vasodilation in patients with diabetes could be a result of endothelial dysfunction. The vasodilatory potency of adenosine in particular may be markedly reduced by aging and further aggravated with diabetes.',\n",

       " 'amitani is widely credited to be the first to have described a pattern of idiopathic upper lobe fibrosis in the japanese literature in 1992. In their case series in 2004, frankel et al. from the interstitial lung disease program at the national jewish medical and research center in denver defined a similar pulmonary fibrotic syndrome. since the early reports , a series of corroborative reports have been published, which have sought to uncover possible causative factors. While several possible associations have become apparent, the aetiology of this disease remains largely enigmatic. For 4 patients, high - resolution ct ( hrct ) data were available , which showed intense pleural thickening with evidence of fibrosis. This corresponded to marked fibrosis of the pleura and the subpleural parenchyma with a homogeneous mix - ture of elastic tissue and dense collagen. There was a relatively abrupt border between the areas of Fibrosis and the surrounding unaffected parenyma with rare fibroblastic foci observed at the interface.  histologically, all patients had intra - alveolar fibrosis with septal elastosis ( iafe ) , with 11 out of 12 also showing fibrosis of the pleura. There were no known associated disorders or presumed causes in this group and the cases were therefore classified as idiopathic ppfe , or  ippfe. There have been reports of changes remini - scent of ppfe in pulmonary disease following both lung and bone marrow transplantation. In 15 of these patients, a pattern of subpleural parenchymal fibroelastosis was noted. This was accompanied by obliterative bronchiolitis in 14 and diffuse alveolar damage in 13 patients. 4 patients who had undergone bone marrow transplantation and subsequently developed pulmonary fibrosis with a classical pattern of ppfe. spectrum included pleural fibrosis, sharply demarcated subpleural and paraseptal intra - alveolar fibroelastosis and obliterative bronchiolitis. of note were ct findings of pneumothoraces with or without a history of recurrent pneumothOrax in all of these patients. possible familial propensity for the development of otherwise idiopathic ppfe was suggested by an earlier french report of three sisters. There was a family history of lung fibrosis in 9% of cases. The patients were virtually exclusively female ( just 1 male patient ) with an average age of just 38. The main radiological and histological differential diagnosis constitutes a pattern of uip. The two most prominent patterns of diffuse parenchymal lung disease in clinical practice today are non - specific interstitial pneumonia ( nsip) and usual interstitialneumon ( uip)  ppfe has a typical upper zone predominance, while uip primarily affects the lower lobes. connective tissue stains which highlight elastic fibre deposition ( such as an elastica van gieson stain ) can therefore be highly valuable in solving this differential diagnosis. The combination of both pleural and parenchymal fibrosis can also be seen in asbestosis and advanced fibrosing sarcoidosis. The so - called  apical cap , which is a localised lesion of subpleural fibrosis that predominantly occurs in the apices of the upper lobes , also enters the differential diagnosis of ppfe. apical caps tend to occur in older cigarette smokers and are typically asymptomatic and non - progressive. ppfe also affects younger , non - smoking patients who present with symptoms and often have a poor clinical outcome.  op has a patchier , haphazard and frequently more peribronchial distribution than the predominant subpleural and paraseptal contiguous areas of fibrosis seen in ppfe. prominent intra - alveolar presence of fibrin on a background of op is typical of acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia ( afop) ocellular pleural exudates ( fig . , this may represent changes consistent with the previously described post - bone marrow transplant idiopathic pneumonia syndrome. classically, dad leads to a more interstitial pattern of initially myxoid - type , and later collagenous fibrosis. In ppfe patients, these often have an appearance reminiscent of the end - stage alveolar duct fibrosis first described in dad.  ppfe appears to be of relatively late onset in post - bone marrow transplant patients. ppfe could represent a consolidation of the intra - alveolar mixture of fibrin and fibroblastic plugs typical of ( acute and fibrinous ) organizing pneumonia. This theory of post - dad/(af)op ppfe is seemingly contradicted by the fact that the idiosyncratic pleural and subpleural localisation of fibrosis in ppfe does not conform to the typical pattern of changes in other bone marrow or lung transplant related lung pathology. The correlation of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome with serositis, fibrosis and pneumothorax may be of particular interest. It is likely that while fibrinous exudates and/or foci of intra - alveolar fibroblastic organisation may form the substrate for ppfe , other factors determine its eventual distribution. The predilection for the upper lobes of ppfe could also be another intriguing pointer towards its potential pathogenesis. pleural infarction , ppfe can be accompanied by marked vascular changes. 8 out of 12 patients showed venous and arterial intimal fibrosis in our recent case series. Pleural effusions could act as a marker of active pleural disease. They could potentially play a pathogenetic role in ppfe.  ppfe is to be regarded as a distinct pattern of pulmonary fibrosis which is likely to be introduced as a separate entity in the new classification scheme of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias. It often runs a rapidly progressive course with a poor prognosis , and can constitute a rare but reproducible response to a range of pulmonary insults. Much remains to be understood about the potential triggers for ppfe ( especially outside the setting of lung and bone marrow transplantation )  ppfe is a separate entity in the spectrum of rare fibrotic lung diseases. Specific radiological and histological features have now been identified which enable its diagnosis with some confidence. This holds particular poignancy for those patients with symptoms and signs of lung fibrosis following lung and bone marrow transplantation.',\n",

Study was specifically designed to analyze the time - effect relationship between ciprofloxacin administration and quinolones resistance in fecal e. coli of pigs. The emergence of resistance in pigs requires drug accumulation for 7 days or more. A certain amount of qrec isolates was present in the  intestine of pigs before ciprafloxACin administration. The use of antimicrobials can influence the number of intestinal microbiota in swine immediately. A recent study showed that chlortetracycline alone at a low - level dose ( 50 g / ton ) had little effect on the microbial population of swine feces. The emergence of resistance in pigs requires drug accumulation for 7 days or more. removing antimicrobial pressure can reduce the number of resistant bacteria but the seeds of resistance could colonize in the animal farm environment for a long time. There was no similarity between e. coli clones that were separated from feces before and after ciprofloxacin administration. No plasmid - mediated resistance genes were detected in qsec and qrec clones. We are inclined to believe that the more likely cause of qrec emergence was the enrichment of qRec in the initial gut microbiota.',\n",

Cavex outline is a commonly used rigid impression material and belongs to the group of metal oxide impression materials. Study aimed to assess the precision of stone casts made using cavex outline impressions after different storage times in order to find the most suitable pouring time and storage temperature. Results showed that storage of cavex outlines in a refrigerator or at room temperature from zero to seven hours had no effect on their dimensional stability. Study: Increasing the storage time decreased the dimensional stability of cavex outline impression material. Study: 24 hours of storage resulted in unacceptable dimensional changes.

The highest prevalence was seen in 70- to 74 -year - old males ( 40.0% ), and in 75- to 79-year -old females ( 41.4% ) The lowest prevalence was found in 55- to 59 -year-old males and Females ( 5.9 and 11.7% ) In men, the ors for oral dryness and number of teeth were 3.683 and 0.946 ( 95% ci = 1.5708.644 and0.8980.997 , respectively ) . this model was shown to be compatible with the hosmer  lemeshow test ( p=0.109 ) with a predictive accuracy of 83.8% . in females, this model showed a predictiveuracy of 78.7% . as these results were similar to those reported by okamoto et al ( 15.1% ) , this study was considered appropriate for the evaluation of dysphagia. Age - related changes in the position of hyoid bone may be a component of decreased swallowing safety and aspiration in older adults. improvement in oral conditions might affect dysphagia. oral hygiene prevents tooth loss and reduces the risk of aspiration pneumonia. oral massage improves the flow rate of saliva in patients with xerostomia. The results obtained from this study are not in accordance with those of previous studies. The reason for this may be due to the fact that unlike the previous studies , subjects who participated in this study were considered healthy. oral dryness and the number of teeth might have stronger associations with swallowing efficacy ( impaired labial seal, oral or pharyngeal residue and piecemeal deglutition ) than swallowing safety. Oral dryness and the number of teeth may be more important risk factors than aging , lifestyle and comorbidity when considering the dynamics of dysphagia in community - dwelling older adults. The interpretation of our results was hampered by lack of data , including insight about denture usage and longitudinal observations.',\n",
       " ' pcv7 has significantly reduced the incidence of pneumococcal diseases in both vaccinated children and unvaccinated individuals of all ages. to overcome this problem , a new vaccine covering more serotypes , especially the emerging serotypes, has been developed. pcv13 was licensed in 2010 for children between 6 weeks and 5 years of age in the united states of america and the european union. Postmarket surveillance and effectiveness studies are highlighted for evaluating newly developed vaccines, particularly those with additional serotypes such as pcv13. We searched pubmed for eligible studies published from january 2010 to august 2014 using the key words, pCV13, 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, children, or pediatric. Most studies on the effectiveness of p CV13 against ipd have demonstrated that pcv 13 introduction has significantly reduced the incidence of ipd in both vaccinated children and unvaccinated population. The most significant reduction of ipd incidence was observed in the group of children aged < 5 years. mortality was more important in adults , particularly in those older than 50 years. The protective effectiveness of each serotype included in pcv13 was different. For example, it was 100% for serotype 7f , 7696% for Serotype 19a , and 1393% forserotype 3.  ipd caused by serotypes 22f and 3 increased from 7% to 11% in children of < 5 years of age during 20102012. The 2 + 1 schedule ( pcv13 administration at 2, 4, and 12 - 13 months ) was started in england, wales , and northern ireland on april 1, 2010. The vaccine effectiveness after 2 doses in the first year or one dose after 12 months was 75% ( 95% confidence interval [ ci ] , 58%84% ) Pneumococcal meningitis cases significantly decreased by 27.4% ( p = 0.041) after the introduction of pcv13 in Israel. The decline of mortality was observed in all groups of different ages and mainly in the nonvaccinated population. For serotypes 1 and 3 there were no significant changes in incidence beyond what would be expected from the natural cyclical patterns. On the contrary, for serotype 19a a significant increase in disease incidence following pcv7 has been reported. . pneumococcal meningitis caused by the 6 additional pcv13 types decreased by 66.7% , but the number of cases due to nonvaccine serotypes remained stable. In uruguay, pcv7 ( schedule 2 + 1) was applied in 2008 and replaced by pCV13 in 2010. A catch-up immunization with a single dose of pcv 13 was offered to children born between 2005 and 2009. Pneumonia hospitalizations and ambulatory visits of cap were compared between the prevaccine ( 20082010 ) and vaccine ( 2011 - 2012 ) periods. The low rates of health facility visits due to cap were also observed , suggesting a significant herd immunity effect. pneumococcal serotypes 1 , 3 , 5 , 7f , and 19a were the most frequently causes of cap after the implementation of pcv7 and the switch from pCV7 to pcv13 in 2010.  pcv7 vaccination had an even more significant impact on recurrent aom by reducing tympanostomy tube placements by 20%24% . pcv13 could significantly reduce the nasopharyngeal colonization by emerging serotypes causing aom. In total , the incidence of all - pneumococcal and all - cause aom decreased by 77% and 60% reductions , respectively. 39 middle ear cultures from 29 patients led to the growth of at least one bacterial pathogen. limited number of s. pneumoniae strains isolated from mef in this study suggests that pcv13 was effective for preventing aom caused by serotypes covered by the vaccine. monitoring the changes of nasopharyngeal carriage induced by pCV13 vaccination is important. Pneumococcal carriage of pcv13 serotypes was observed in nonvaccinated children but was blunted in vaccinated children. No evidence of replacement has been observed to date in the UK. Only 3.4% ( 95% ci , 1.96.1 ) children 20 years of age were positive of pneumococcal. carriage in the period of 2012 - 2 - 013 , which was lower than the last two periods. Pcv13 vaccination resulted in significantly higher effectiveness against ipd , mucosal pneumococcal diseases , and pneumococCal carriage than pcv7. pcv13 has been implemented for a relatively short time and long - term surveillance should be conducted in the future to further evaluate the safety and effectiveness of this novel vaccine.',\n",
       " 'Transoral robotic surgery ( tors ) is a technique increasingly used in surgical excision of tongue base neoplasms. variations of anatomy , tumor characteristics , and surgeon expertise often contribute to the technical difficulty associated with this method. We propose an evaluative process to preoperatively determine the feasibility of robotic surgical access using cephalometric measurements. Two intersecting lines were created in each radiograph. The distance from the intersection of these two lines to the gonion and hyoid were subsequently recorded and evaluated independently and as a ratio. Mallampati scores were gathered from anesthesia preoperative records and compared to the surgeon s designation of adequate or restricted exposure using the chi test. Of the 31 patients evaluated, 15 were stratified as  adequate exposure and 16 were deemed  restricted exposure. The majority of the bot pathology results ( 17/31 ) were squamous cell carcinomas. The patient s ages varied 3578 with bmis of 20.736.1 and duration of surgery ranged 40180  min.  adequate exposure group ( mean of 7.8    3.6 mm ) when compared to the restricted group (mean of 4.7   1.9  mm ) ( p  =  0.006 ) ( fig . .  2posterior pharyngeal wall to hyoid / soft palate distance and epiglottis to vertical larynx angle : a , c adequate exposure , and b , d restricted exposure.  length of the surgery ( 40180  min ) did correlate with the quality of exposure ( table  1 ) . over the past 4  years the application of transoral robotic surgery has grown extensively. isolated tonsil primaries and some of the high base of tongue primaries can be resected with less difficultly utilizing tors. Measurements determined in this study using roc curve and t test analysis would indicate that a posterior pharyngeal wall to hyoid measurement less than 30  mm is considered a risk factor for a restricted view. These measurements did not compute out to determine the difficulty of exposure. A lower mallampati score was predictive of adequate exposure.',\n",
       " \"Dyspepsia refers to upper abdominal pain or discomfort, which is taught to arise from the upper gastrointestinal tract. The prevalence of this disorder varies between 3% and 40% in different studies. Risk factors have been found to have associated with these disorders such as helicobacter pylori infection, psychiatric disorders and behavioral characteristics. The prevalence of functional dyspepsia in kerman was 16.1% ( 95% confidence interval : 14.3 - 18.1%) from a total of 2320 individuals enrolled in the study. No statistically significant difference was observed between males and females regarding age ( p = 0.7 ) among the participants. Results showed that although the dyspepsy was more common in females ( 17.1%), it was also common in young adults ( 18.9%) and subjects with academic education ( 16.8%) The prevalence of functional dyspepsia was lower among high fruit and vegetable consumers than among tea - coffee and fast food consumers. There was no statistically significant difference between males and females in the relevant symptoms. Current smoking and drinking teacoffee and alcohol increased the risk of functional DyspepsIA about 5% and 30% respectively. Our study showed that the prevalence of functional dyspepsia was about 16% and it was significantly associated with anxiety and depressive disorder. The prevalence of the disease was slightly greater among females , and peaked in the age group 25- 34 years old. The rates in our study were very close to the rates of the studies conducted in western iran, china and us. Anxiety but not depression found to be a significant risk factor for the functional dyspepsia. abdominal obesity in dyspeptic patients was more than that of other participants in our study. The behavioral risk factors such as smoking and the alcohol and coffee consumption had no relationship with functional dysPEPSia. Such risk factors can be linked to a person's risk of developing cancer. Such risk factors include high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and other conditions. Such factors can play a role in the development of cancer, as well as other conditions such as stroke and heart disease.\",\n",
       " 'adjacent segment disease ( asd) following uninstrumented anterior cervical discectomy and fusion ( acdf ) has been reported to have an incidence of 2.9% per year. This article critically examines the evidence that cervical artificial disc replacement has lived up to the promise of minimizing adjacent level disease. Four studies compared cervical total disc arthroplasty ( prestige and bryan discs ) to anterior cervical discectomy and fusion ( acdf). Two reports overlapped but use different definitions of asd;2,3,4,5 thus , only the most complete report was included for analysis. Risks of symptomatic asd were similar across studies ( range of risk difference between treatment arms : 1.5%2.3% ) , and was only marginally significant for one study at 24 months. One rct reported a significant decreased risk of radiographic asd in the kineflex / c treatment group. In studies with longer follow - up, rates of symptodic asd increased in both treatment groups over time. No consistent correlation between angular rom at adjacent segments with ndi , neck or arm pain in either treatment group. Loss to follow - up ( > 15% ) with respect to cephalad motion evaluation was noted and may lead to potential selection bias. within groups, time from surgery was a significant predictor of change in adjacent segment motion. The article by mummaneni et al 4 is the original report of the fda ide study. burkus et al 3 report the long - term follow - up. summary of results from studies reporting rates of radiographic asd*. * definitions of asd differ between studies. general clinical guidelines related to cervical c - adr are summarized elsewhere in this issue. There is inconclusive evidence to support the role of arthroplasty as a means of decreasing adjacent level disease. Some of the lack of evidence is due to inadequate follow up and there are unpublished but nationally presented reports that with the prodisc - c there is a statistically significant difference in reoperation rates at 5 years. until the peer - review process is completed and the article published , we can not comment on the validity of their conclusions.',\n",
       " 'The generation of the hypoxia - induced rat model of iugr has been described in detail previously ( 2325 ) at birth, litters were reduced to eight male pups. At 3 weeks of age, female offspring were killed and male pup were weaned and housed two per cage. immediately after weaning, all offspring exposed to different prenatal interventions started receiving an hf diet ( 45% fat ; research diets d12451 ) Half of the animals from each litter were randomly allocated to receive additional supplementation with resv in the diet ( 4 g / kg of diet ) After 9 weeks of nutritional intervention, body composition was determined using a whole body test. Rats were anesthetized using inhaled isoflurane ( 2% in compressed air ) and placed into a micro single - photon emission computed tomography ( spect ) scanner. The intra - abdominal fat volume was calculated using the software gmi - amira 3.1.1 . threshold density was adjusted by internal volume so that internal organs and large vessels were not counted as intra- abdominal fat tissue. lotting , homogenates were prepared in ice - cold sucrose homogenization buffer as described ( 27 ) . intra - abdominal fat was extracted and weighed , and samples of omental adipose tissue were fixed in 10% formalin for 48 h. histological sections and hematoxylin / eosin staining were performed at the alberta diabetes institute histology core ( edmonton , ab , canada ) following standardized protocols.  measurements of body weight and food consumption over time, as well as gtt and itt , were analyzed using a two - way anova with both time and group as sources of variation. elisa kits for the determination of insulin were purchased from alpco diagnostics , and leptin kits were bought from millipore. sn-1,2-dioleylglycerol was purchased from avanti , and most other reagents and chemicals were purchased by sigma - aldrich. Body composition was determined using a whole body composition analyzer based on time - domain nuclear magnetic resonance technology ( echomri 4-in-1/1000 ; echo medical systems ) rats were anesthetized using inhaled isoflurane ( 2% in compressed air ) and placed into a micro single - photon emission computed tomography ( spect ) scanner flex pre - clinical platform xo - xpet - xspet instrument ( -medica ideas ) The intra - abdominal fat volume was calculated using the software gmi - amira 3.1.1 . threshold density was adjusted by internal volume so that internal organs and large vessels were not counted as intra- abdominal fat tissue. Tissues were dissected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen as described ( 27 ) for immunoblotting. Lipids were extracted from 200 l of plasma and tg , cholesterol ester , and free fatty acids were separated by fast - protein liquid chromatography as described. histological sections and hematoxylin / eosin staining were performed at the alberta diabetes institute histology core. indirect calorimetry was performed using the comprehensive laboratory animal monitoring system ( oxymax / clams ; columbus instruments ) Body weight and food consumption over time, as well as gtt and itt, were analyzed using a two - way anova with both time and group as sources of variation. Differences in measurements performed among four groups were analyzed. exposure of rats to prenatal hypoxia had no effect on body weight gain. food intake was decreased in iugr offspring compared with control rats independently of the administration of resv. iugr rats exhibited a reduction in vo2 , vco2 , and heat production during both light and dark cycles relative to controls regardless of whether they were receiving resv in their diets. iugr offspring fed an hf diet had larger adipocyte diameters than control offspring receiving the same nutritional intervention. In agreement with greater abdominal fat mass, circulating leptin levels were higher in hf - fed iugR rats compared with control hf- fed offspring. Resv reduced circulating levels of tg and free fatty acids in offspring born iugr. Liver and skeletal muscle tg , diacylglycerol , and ceramide levels were elevated in iugR offspring compared with control offspring. Resv prevented the development of hyperinsulinemia and elevated the homeostasis model assessment index. Resv administration prevents iugr rats from developing hf - induced insulin resistance. The insulin signaling cascade regulates both hepatic glucose output as well as glucose transport into skeletal muscle. We determined the phosphorylation status of protein kinases in the insulin signaling cascades in the tissues of rats isolated 15 min after insulin injection. We found that resv prevented a decrease in insulin - stimulated akt phosphorylated in the liver and skeletal muscle of iugR offspring.  resv prevented molecular signaling defects observed in iugr rats fed an hf diet. These improvements contributed to the prevention of hf - induced insulin resistance in iUGr rats. measurements were made in the liver and gastrocnemius tissues of rats after 9 weeks. phosphorylation of akt ( p - akt  to  akt ratio ; a ) , phosphorylated of the irs-1 ( p- irs  to irs ratio ; b ) , and phosphorylations of pkc (p - pkC/tubulin ; c ) are shown. Resv - mediated activation of ampk contributes to the prevention of hf - induced insulin resistance in iugr rats. measurements were made in the liver and gastrocnemius muscle tissues of rats after 9 weeks of an hf diet or a resv diet. We examined the effect of postnatal feeding an hF ( hf- c ) diet or anhf diet supplemented with resv (hf - r ) for 9 weeks. iugr rats exhibited a reduction in vo2 , vco2 , and heat production during both light and dark cycles relative to controls regardless of whether they were receiving resv in their diets. Resv reduced the abdominal fat content as determined by both abdominal tomographic imaging and surgical dissection of fat depots. iugr offspring fed an hf diet had larger adipocyte diameters than control offspring. iugr and resv had no effect on fasting blood glucose levels after 9 weeks of hf diet. Resv prevented the development of hyperinsulinemia and elevated the homeostasis model assessment index in iugr offspring compared with control offspring. resv improved both glucose disposal and glucose disposal. Resv administration prevents iugr rats from developing hf - induced insulin resistance. We measured the phosphorylation status of protein kinases in the insulin signaling cascade in the tissues of rats isolated 15 min after insulin injection. We found that resv administration prevented a decrease in insulin - stimulated akt phosphorylated in the liver and skeletal muscle. We also found that the inhibition of irs-1 was reversed by resv treatment in both organs. During hf - diet feeding, liver and skeletal muscle pkc activity was increased in iugr rats compared with controls ( fig . 4c) More importantly , and consistent with the reduction of lipid accumulation in the tissues ( table 1 ) and prevention of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance ( fig. 3 ) , pkC phosphorylation was reduced by resv in the iugR offspring ( fig%. 4c ) Together, these data indicate that resv prevented molecular signaling defects observed in iugs. iugr offspring subjected to an hf diet are more susceptible to developing several components of the mets than control offspring fed the same diet ( 9) This is the first study demonstrating that early postnatal administration of resv in the diet of young rats improved the metabolic profile of hf - fed offspring born iugr secondary to a prenatal hypoxic insult.  resv preferentially targets abdominal adipocytes to increase lipolysis and reduce the mass of this fat depot. Resv reduced the hf diet - induced hyperlipidemia that is observed in iugr offspring. resv inhibited fatty acid and tg synthesis by isolated hepatocytes, suggesting that the lipid - lowering effects of resv could be attributed to direct effects on hepatic function.  resv mediates these beneficial effects ( 1517 ) . recent findings using hf - fed ampk-1 and -2deficient mice demonstrated that the effects of resv on insulin sensitivity required the presence of either ampk isoform. activation of ampk in skeletal muscle increases glucose utilization in glucose - intolerant mice in an insulin - independent fashion.  resv represents the first potential pharmacological treatment that could reduce the susceptibility for an adverse metabolic profile. associated with being born iugr are currently lacking. If administered to vulnerable pediatric patient populations consuming high - calorie diets, resv could reduce susceptibility to adverse metabolic profiles.',\n",
       " 'Most colorectal cancers ( crcs) arise from neoplastic adenomatous polyps. serrated polyps have the potential to develop into sporadic crc via a series of molecular alterations. tsas and ssa / ps have significant malignant potential and are associated with subsequent development of metachronouspolyps. This was a retrospective single - center cohort study of consecutive patients with colorectal polyps who underwent er from march 2003 to october 2014 at toyonaka municipal hospital. We analyzed the clinicopathological findings , complete en bloc resection rate , and frequency and characteristics of coexistent carcinoma in serrated polyps resected by er. The typical indication for er of a colorectal polyp is size >  5  mm. The final decision to perform er is made by each physician based on the patient s condition and bowel preparation. Flat and depressed lesions that were difficult to distinguish from adenoma or carcinoma were generally resected. Patients who did not achieve a clean colon on initial colonoscopy underwent repeat er. A total of 21,048 resected polyps from 15,326 patients ( 70.0  % men ) were identified based on pathology reports from march 2003 to october 2014 at toyonaka municipal hospital. tsas were diagnosed based on the following findings : villiform growth, serrated epithelium associated with nuclear and cytological atypia, ectopic crypt formation, and eosinophilic cytoplasm. hps were diagnosedbased on findings of a serrated. epithelial architecture in the upper part of the crypts, proliferative zones limited to the lower part of. the crypt, and the absence of cytologic dysplasia. Clinical and endoscopic findings of ssa / ps revealed a male sex ( 68.6  % ) and sessile type ( 73.1  %) predominance. Among the tsas, 1 ( 0.7 %) showed coexistent adenocarcinoma. The optimal tumor size cut-off value for coexisting adenOCarcinomas was 10  mm ( auc : 0.84 ) Adenocarcinoma was found in 8.2  % of the traditional adenomatous polyps ( 1,318/15,984 ) ( fig .  1 ) The coexisting adenocArcinoma rate was significantly lower in ssa / ps ( p  < 0.0001 ) and tsas ( 1 polyp ; p  =  0.0014 ) than in traditional adanomatOUS polyps. serrated lesions of the colorectum are histologically characterized by a serrated appearance of the crypt epithelium. Until recently, serrated polyps were not differentiated from hyperplastic polyps and were not thought to require polypectomy. Lash et al. reported that 1.7  % of a population of 179,111 patients with 290,810 mucosal polyps had ssa / ps ( with and without dysplasia ) They also reported that 0.9  % ( 21/2416 lesions ) of the patients with sSA / ps had adenocarcinoma. In the current study , the overall frequency of ssa/ ps was 3.0  %. tsas are much less common than ssa or ps, accounting for only 0.6  percent of polyps. A tumor size of 10  mm was found to be the optimal cut-off value for coexisting adenocarcinoma. Males accounted for a large proportion of the patients with ssa / ps ( 68.6  % ) but conversely, females accounted for 80.0  % of those with coexistingAdenocARCinoma in the high - risk group. The rate of progression from a serrated lesion to crc is unknown. Most colorectal polyps <  5  mm were not resected in this study. The rate of recurrence after er was similar for ssa / ps and traditional adenomas 27. These findings suggest that the best surveillance strategy after er for serrated polyps might be the same as that fortraditional adenomatous polyps. The overall frequency of ssa / ps was 3.0  % among all resected polyps in the present study. The rate of coexisting adenocarcinoma in serrated polyps was significantly lower than that in traditional adenomatous polyps. resection perhaps should be recommended to females with serratedpolyps   10 mm because of the increased risk of coexistent carcinoma.',\n",
       " 'mouthwashes are fluids containing active components with antiseptic , antibiotic , antifungal , astringent and anti - inflammatory effects on the oral cavity and pharynx. They are also recommended to prevent oral diseases , such as caries and gingivitis , and to reduce plaque formation. Some of the key ingredients include chlorhexidine gluconate, benzydamine hydrochloride, cetylpyridinium chloride, triclosan, hydrogen peroxide, povidone - iodine, fluoride and essential oils. Previous studies have shown that mouthwashes are used by the general population. In a multicentre case - control study conducted in ten european countries 42% of all participants rinsed with mouthwash. alcoholic beverages were extensively studied by type, with varying alcohol content in liquor , wine and beer. The questionnaire included questions regarding mouthwash use, frequency of use, number of mouthfuls, dilution of mouthwash and the time the mouthwash is kept inside the mouth. A list with descriptions and coloured images of all mouthwashes available on the united kingdom market was provided as part of the questionnaire. Participants who had filled in the muq were used as controls in the feasibility study of cancer of the head and neck. Ethanol calibration curve was prepared ranging from 5 - 400 mg / dl using ethanol standard solutions. linearity was observed with ethanol concentrations up to 400 mg/ dl ( y = 0.002x + 0.0034 ; r =0.999 ) mouthwash was mixed with 2.4 m nacl ( 1 : 9 dilution ) containing n - propyl alcohol ( 5% v / v ) as an internal standard. ethanol levels exceeding the linearity of the assay were diluted 1 : 100 in 2. 4 mnacl. One alcohol unit was considered to equal half a standard glass ( 175 ml ) of wine ( abv 12% ) as suggested by drinkaware.co.uk and gill et al . therefore results were multiplied by 0.5 to obtain the number of glasses of wine  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 rinsed per use of mouthwash. factors used were 0. 5 ( < once a week ) , 1.5 ( once or twice a week) , 3 ( every other day ) , 7 ( once a day ) and 21 ( three times a day) The mean age was 63.0 ( 10.2 ) years ( range  46 - 81 years ) in group 16 participants ( 22% ) had rinsed with mouthwash in the past while a majority of 45 ( 62% ) were currently using mouthwash. The majority of participants used mouthwash either once ( 27% ) or twice daily ( 24% ) The conversion of the amount of alcohol containing mouthwash rinses by participants  into glasses of wine resulted in 52% rinsing with the equivalent of 1 to 25 wine  glasses per year. The most common brand of mouthwash used in group 2 was listerine ( johnson & johnson limited , maidenhead , uk ) ( 30% ) This was followed by colgate ( colgate palmolive , guilford, uk) ( 15% ) , corsodyl ( cors Codyl , brentford , u k ) ( 13% ) and aquafresh ( glaxosmithkline , uxbridge , uK ) ( 11% ) Study population was refreshment of bad breath ( 75% ) followed closely by elimination of bacteria and reduction of plaque formation ( table 2) The majority of participants who reported that they currently used mouthwash in the pilot grampian adult dental health survey also reported this in the mouthwash use questionnaire ( 85.7% ) For frequency of use, substantial agreement was found comparing group 1 and 2 ( weighted kappa = 0.62 [ 0.43 , 0.77 ] ) for these groups the alcohol content of the mouth wash brands used was also investigated. Study identified that the risk of developing cancers of the oral cavity , pharynx , larynx or oesophagus increased with the consumption of 1.5 litres of wine per day. Exposure of oral cavity to ethanol from mouthwash use is much lower than that of alcohol consumption. No statistically significant association between the brand of mouthwash used and oral or pharyngeal cancer. Mouthwash use questionnaire was proven to be a valid and reliable tool for the  examination of mouthwash use in the general population. future studies should support more accurate assessment of alcohol content in mouthwash. tanja wirth worked on this project while taking part in an erasmus student placement under the european lifelong learning programme.',\n",

       " 'infections are a leading cause of death in the intensive care unit. There is only one intervention licensed by the us food and drug administration , drotrecogin alpha ( xigris) The advent of genomics and systems biology have led to the identification of previously unrecognized targets on bacteria.

       " 'Liver ischemia and reperfusion ( i / r)-induced injury is a major complication associated with liver transplantation and resectional surgery. The vast majority of studies performed in experimental animals have used in situ models of liver i /r. Reperfusion of ischemic tissue initiates a cascade of molecular and cellular events that culminate in the superoxide anion radical ( o2 ) dependent superoxide radical. i / r is thought to represent an important initiating event in the pathophysiology of post - ischemic injury in a variety of different tissues including the liver, heart, kidney and gut. i / r - induced decrease in the bioavailability of no is mediated directly or indireclty by the o2-dependent decomposition of endogenous no. Overproduction of o2 would also alter the redox potential of the liver creating a more oxidative environment. i / r - induced over - production of ros reduces ( or eliminates) the important vasoactive mediator and cytoprotective no free radical. ros induces the rapid oxidation of cellular gsh creating a more positive redox potential within the liver. o2 is the major ros responsible for post - ischemic hepatocellular injury. Kc - derived nadph oxidase is critically involved in promoting post ischemic liver injury. exactly how cell - derived o2 promotes liver injury is not known but emerging data suggest that multiple mechanisms are likely involved. i / r - induced liver injury in enos - deficient ( enos ) mice or wild type mice pretreated with the nos inhibitor n(g)-nitro - l - arginine methyl ester ( l - name) exacerbates liver injury suggesting that no is protective in nature. rophage inflammatory protein-2 , keritinocyte - derived chemokine , and epithelial neutrophil - activating peptide ) as well as nitric oxide synthase-2 ( inos ) and cyclooxygenase- 2 ( cox2 ) . expression of the majority of these genes is regulated by the transcription factor nf-b. There is great interest in understanding how the molecular events associated with i / r - mediated activation of nf -b and the subsequent induction and roles of the different cytokines , chemokines , adhesion molecules and enzymes. Evidence suggests that nf-b activation may be to protect a variety of cells from the injurious effects of certain pro - inflammatory cytokines such as tnf-. ikk has been shown to be required for embryonic development of skin and limbs whereas ikk appears essential for normal liver development. regulated during i / r as well as the cellular location of nf-b activation dictates whether nf -b activation will promote injury or protection. There is a large body of work suggesting that the major ros responsible for post - ischemic hepatocellular injury is o2. Exactly how cell - derived o2 promotes liver injury is not known. idation represented an important pathway for i / r - induced damage ; however other investigations cautioned that oxidative degradation of membrane lipids may , in reality , be a consequence rather than a cause of liver injury. more recent studies suggest that o2 may directly or indirectly mediate cell and tissue injury by rapidly interacting with and damaging mitochondrial membrane proteins. in addition to its direct biochemical effects , O2 may mediate hepatocellular damage indirectly via the up - regulation ( or down - regulation ) of certain redox - sensitive genes. The expression of tnf- , il-1 and il-12 are important for mediating post - ischemic liver injury. There is great interest in understanding how the molecular events associated with i / r - mediated activation of nf-b and the subsequent induction and roles of the different cytokines , chemokines , adhesion molecules and enzymes. nf-. it is well known that pre - treatment of cultured cells with non - lethal concentrations of tnf- protects these cells from a subsequent challenge by lethal amounts of this cytokine. ikk has been shown to be required for embryonic development of skin and limbs whereas ikk appears essential for normal liver development with massive liver apoptosis , injury and embryonic lethality occurring in ikk-deficient mice. i / r - induced liver injury in mice with a hepatocyte - specific deletion of ikk ( nemo ) was dramatically increased compared to wild type mice. This suggests a protective effect of hepatocyte nf-b. However, ikk-deficient hepatocytes have no detectable nf -b activity and thus no protective response to limit liver damage. iiver i / r results in rapid endothelial dysfunction in a number of different tissues. decreased steady state production of no would in all likelihood increase the redox potential of hepatocytes , kcs and/or secs in favor of a more oxidative environment. nos inhibitors are nonspecific inhibitors of both enos and inos as well as potent vasoconstrictors. The potentially protective role of endogenous no in liver i / r injury is supported by studies demonstrating enhanced hepatocellular injury in post - ischemic animals rendered deficient in enos. No is known to interact with and decompose o2 or other reactive radicals or oxidants thereby limiting the formation of o2-derived oxidants. No - dependent activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase ( sgc ) with the subsequent production of the vasorelaxant cgmp may protect against reperfusion injury by enhancing blood flow. No may also inhibit mitochondrial respiration via interaction with complex i and/or cytochrome c oxidase . this would inhibit apoptosis , maintain small but significant amounts of oxygen during ischemia and allow for a more controlled resumption of respiration following reperfusions.  nitrite may be metabolized to no in ischemic tissue ( via deoxyhb or mb ) and exert no - dependent protective effects site. nitrite is cytoprotective in different models of tissue i / r including the liver, heart, kidney and brain. The mechanisms by which this nitrogen oxide protects the post-ischemic liver remain to be defined.',\n",
       " 'pathological adnexal masses ( not including physiological corpus luteal cysts during the first 14 weeks of gestation ) are noted in 1% - 2% of pregnancies. 11% of these are endometriomas. ovarian mass detection during pregnancy is not uncommon. decidualized tissue can increase in size during pregnancy whilst producing a gross and sonographic appearance mimicking malignancy. The patient represented to the emergency department at 15 weeks gestation with further excruciating abdominal pain requiring large doses of opiates. An emergency laparotomy was performed as torsion or rupture of the cystic lesion was suspected. Adnexal masses discovered in pregnancy are commonly benign in nature with conservative management being the norm. Even benign masses can be symptomatic and cause obstetric complications. Recommendations for conservative or surgical intervention during pregnancy are largely dependent on the clinician s assessment of the patient. factors such as perceived risk of ovarian cancer, gestational age at presentation as well as risk of adverse events for the mother or fetus require consideration. managing suspected ovarian cancer in pregnancy needs extensive multidisciplinary expertise and cooperation of specialists in neonatology, perinatology and gynecology.  increased vascularity , one of the sonographic signs of suspicious pelvic tumors , occurs in decidualized tissue due to thickening of the stroma and procurement of an extensive vascular supply. three dimensional ( 3d ) sonography enhances the images obtained , allowing the papillary appearance of the tumor to be clearly outlined.  decidualized ovarian endometrioma in pregnancy tends to present as a complex adnexal cystic mass. enlargement and possible directly bleeding into the cyst itself , leading to rupture. however , awareness of its occurrence and the specific imaging findings using the combination of both ultrasonography and mr examination may be possible for this rare entity.',\n",
       " 'msc are multipotent cells capable of differentiating into different lineages. They suppress innate and adaptive immunity as well as their poor immunogenicity. The therapeutic potential of hmsc as immunoregulatory agents is currently being explored in clinical trials. The characterization of the immunological properties of hdoc may be of crucial importance for cell - based tissue - engineering therapeutic strategies. Human mscs ( hmscs) were isolated from bm aspirates of healthy donors. Hmscs were seeded at 3.1  10 cells / cm and grown in osteogenic differentiation medium ( lonza) Osteogenic differentiation was analysed by cytological staining and by the evaluation of runx2 mrna levels ( figure s1) doc were used either in adhesion on the same plate used for differentiation ( adh - doc ) or after harvesting and replating ( det - doc) for harvesting , monolayers of hdoc were washed with washing buffer ( 0.5% bsa , 5  mm edta in pbs ) and incubated with trypsin. For each experiment , the cell number was evaluated the day before the assays by counting 3 wells of adh-doc harvested separately. Cells were labelled with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester ( cfse , 2.5  m from sigma aldrich ) before plating. To test the capacity of adh - doc and det - doc to modulate the dc allostimulatory capacity , allogeneic mo - dc , either immature or mature , were irradiated ( 3000  cgy ) and plated ( 1  :  1 ) at 37c.  cell cultures were incubated at 37c for 5 days; then the t cells were harvested from the upper chamber and stained for immunophenotype via tricolor immunofluorescence. After 2 washes , samples were analyzed using bd facscantoii equipment ( bd biosciences ) . immature and mature mo - dc were. incubated for five days either alone or with adh - doc or det - doc ( 1  :  1 ) . doc on dc - mediated t cell proliferation. Both det - doc and adh - doc inhibited the allostimulatory capacity of dc ( kruskal wallis p < 0.0001 ) However, the inhibition induced by adh- doc is much stronger than det- doc. To investigate the mechanism(s) involved in such process, we first asked whether det-doc were less viable. Then, we asked whether the procedure used to detach cells from the plates influenced by itself the tolerogenic capacity of detached doc. We wanted to investigate which surface marker(s) on dc may be affected by the inhibitory activity of hdoc [ 24 , 25 ] to this end, we cocultured dc with either det - doc or adh - doc for 5 days. To discriminate dc from hdoc we gated on hla - dr cells. coculture of t cells with dc increased the percentage of t cell proliferation. The addition of det - doc or adh - doc decreased the population of cd4cd25foxp3 t cells induced by dc. The adh- doc showed the greatest inhibitory effect ( p < 0.001 , bonferroni corrected ) The inhibitory capacity of hdoc is markedly increased when hdoc are left adherent to the same plate used for differentiation. This effect may be mediated by different modulation of cd80 and cd86 costimulatory molecules on dc by the two different preparations. Culture of t cells with dc increased the percentage of cd4cd161cd196 t cells, as compared to cd3 t cells alone. The addition of det - doc enhanced the generation of the t cells induced by dc, while the addition of adh - doc significantly decreased that population. The ability to modulate the dc - mediated t cell generation was mediated by cytokine secretion rather than by a cell - to- cell contact - dependent mechanism. llular milieu towards a tolerogenic environment , il-10 was also tested and no differences were found ( figure s3 ) . taken together , these data demonstrate that hdoc can modulate the dc induction of cd4cd161cd196 t cells via il-6/tgf- regulation. Different capacity of det - doc and of adh - doc to modulate induction of t cell phenotype may be due to the different balance between il- 6 and tgf- secreted or induced by these cells. Det - doc are less potent than adh - doc to inhibit the allostimulation of dc in a contact - dependent manner. det - doc do not modify the expression of cd86 , while they weakly downregulate cd80. On the other hand, adh- doc strongly downregulates cd80 and cd86 on dc, resulting in a more profound inhibition of t cell proliferation. Different manipulation techniques could result in different immunological properties of hdoc. Better definition of the most suitable culture system for hdoc preparation may have relevant clinical implications for their implantation in the context of bone repair cell - based tissue - engineering clinical trials. Our report about different in vitro capacity of det - doc and adh - doc in modulating dc functions offers the rationale to specifically address , at the clinical level , the safety and immunomodulatory capacity of doc.',\n",
       " 'Several studies have suggested that fluid collection within the lumbar facet as detected on mri is indicative of segmental instability. We hypothesized that excess facet fluid without radiographic instability has no impact on the results of minimally invasive decompression surgery. The laminotomy was performed on the side of approach in the area of the ligamentum flavum insertion. The basal part of the spinous process of the caudal half of the cranial lamina and a small cranial portion of theCaudal lamina were removed. From january 2008 to december 2010 , a total of 378 patients were surgically treated for lss and followed for at least 2 years. 120 patients underwent decompression and fusion surgery due to segmental instability as defined by the above criteria. 179 underwent mbdu for multilevel decompression or decompression at levels other than l4l5. 79 cases fulfilled our investigation criteria of not having segmental unstable and then at least 24 months of follow-up. Facet joint effusion was defined as a measurable , curvilinear , high - intensity signal within the facet joint which closely matched that of cerebrospinal fluid. measurements were taken perpendicular to the apparent joint line and the largest value was recorded as the effusion size. Only bilateral l4l5 facets were evaluated and the worst grade for either side of each joint was recorded. From january 2008 to december 2010 , a total of 378 patients were surgically treated for lss and followed for at least 2 years. 120 patients underwent decompression and fusion surgery due to segmental instability as defined by the above criteria. 179 underwent mbdu for multilevel decompression or decompression at levels other than l4l5. Facet joint effusion was defined as a measurable , curvilinear , high - intensity signal within the facet joint. The patients were divided into three groups by the following grades. none of the 79 patients experienced major complications following mbdu. No patient required additional surgery at the lumbar spine during the follow - up period. Previous studies have suggested that facet joint effusion is a sign of lumbar segmental instability. This hypothesis was first studied by chaput et al in 2007 and later confirmed by rihn et al, cho et al , and lattig et al. In patients without radiographic instability , facet Joint effusion has no effect on the outcome of minimally invasive decompression surgery for lss. In 1991, young et al described the microsurgical fenestration technique and devised mbdu as a minimally invasive technique. In 1991, weiner et al reported satisfactory results in follow - up periods averaging up to 2 years. sasai et al revealed that the postoperative progression of slip percentage is almost the same as that of the natural course reported by matsunaga et al in an analysis of spondylolisthesis in 145 nonsurgical patients. This study is the first of the effect of facet joint effusion without radiographic instability on surgical outcome. The group sizes were rather small , and thus the present investigation can only be considered a pilot study. Further studies should attempt to replicate these findings in larger groups of patients with longer follow-up periods evaluating postoperative radiographic stability.',\n",
       " 'Poststroke fatigue ( psf) is a feeling of early exhaustion with weariness, lack of energy and aversion to effort that develops during physical or mental activity. psf appears to be related to higher mortality rates and poorer rehabilitation outcomes. The pathogenesis of psf is still poorly understood and until now, effective treatments are still lacking. The nature of the psychosocial profile of patients suffering from psf is still largely unknown. The aim of this study was to compare a psychological and social profile of stroke patients to the one of healthy control subjects and patients with other chronic diseases. The study was approved by the local ethics committee and all eligible subjects signed an informed consent. Data on age, sex, marital status, educational level, and stroke type and side were obtained from the patients and their medical records. severity of paresis was assessed with the motricity index ( mi ) of the affected lower extremity. to study the psychosocial characteristics of patients with psf, self - report questionnaires regarding depression, anxiety and psychological distress were used. The self - efficacy scale ( ses) was used to assess the sense of control in relation to fatigue complaints. The presence of personality problems was determined by calculating a psi from the raw scores of the scl. associations between the cis - f - fss fatigue scales and gender, marital status , lesion characteristics , and psi were calculated with 2 analyses. Patients had a median age of 4.3 years, which did not differ significantly between single and recurrent strokes. The incidence rate indicated that 93.2% of the patients were free from personality problems. The scores on the scl were generally high compared to healthy controls , but in comparison to other patient groups were average. The aim of this investigation was to obtain a psychosocial profile of patients suffering from severe psf in order to tease out options for the rehabilitation of fatigue. In comparison to healthy controls, psf - patients reported high psychossocial distress and high positive social support. However, compared to other chronic patient groups, we found no marked discrepancies with regard to distress, coping styles, social support , and self - efficacy. As soon as subjects are able to deal with their functional limitations more effectively , taking into account their limited attentional capacity and mental energy , fatigue may gradually become less severe. graded physical activity programs might be an important contribution to the treatment of psf. such programs might help stroke patients to gradually increase physical activity without experiencing distressing bodily symptoms. Patient education and goal setting could be added to improve patient motivation and adherence. Since symptoms of depression and anxiety are common in psf patients , it is important to address these when present. resources available to patients suffering from psf might also be beneficial. These compensation strategies could entail an enhanced planning and variation of activities to foster a more regular pattern of activity and rest.',\n",

       " \"pgp is the most well characterized drug transporter in the abc protein superfamily. It causes multidrug resistance by using energy derived from atp hydrolysis to transport substrates across the plasma membrane. Tumors expressing pgp are resistant to a variety of structurally and functionally diverse anticancer drugs that are pgp substrates.  pgp is a component of the blood  brain barrier. Animals with defective pgp function are highly susceptible to toxicosis when treated with drugs that are pgp substrates. substrates for pgp include not only anticancer drugs, but a wide variety of other drugs as well. Mdr1 mutant / mutant dogs experience severe neurological toxicosis at much lower doses ( ~120  g / kg) because the defective blood  brain barrier allows ivermectin to accumulate in brain tissue. pgp is expressed on both renal tubular cells and biliary canalicular cells but whether or not it plays a clinically relevant role in renal drug excretion in dogs is not known.  decreased biliary excretion of chemotherapy drugs would increase the patient 's overall exposure to the drug. This increase in the likelihood of druginduced toxicity such as myelosuppression and adverse gastrointestinal effects. Mdr1 mutant / mutant dogs are significantly more likely to develop hematologic toxicity , both neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.  deficient pgpmediated biliary excretion is the mechanism responsible for the increased sensitivity of mdr1 mutant / mutant. dogs to chemotherapeutic drugs that are pgp substrates. intrathecal administration of vincristine in human patients is associated with central neuropathy consisting of ascending progressive radiculomyeloencephalopathy. Many drugs commonly used in veterinary patients are also capable of inhibiting pgp function. ketoconazole increases brain penetration of ivermectin in mdr1 normal / normal dogs causing the same neurological toxicity one would expect to see in a collie with themdr1 mutation. ketconazole 's ability to inhibit pgpmediated biliary excretion can mimic what occurs in dogs with the mdr 1 mutation. Mdr1 normal / normal dogs had 1.8fold greater biliary clearance of tcsestamibi before treatment with the pgp inhibitor ketonazole than after treatment with ketoconazole. Similar effects would be expected for chemotherapeutic drugs whose clearance involves pgp mediated biliary excretion ( ie , vinca alkaloids , doxorubicin , taxol) There is anecdotal and experimental evidence that drug  drug interactions involving pglycoprotein occur in mdr1 normal / normal dogs. pgp inhibitors can act by blocking the drug binding site either competitively , noncompetitive or allosterically. It is not possible to predict which pgp substrate drugs in table 1 would be safe to use concurrently with pgp inhibiting drugs.\",\n",

When we mixed phospholipid ( popc ) vesicles with mgcl2 , we saw no detectable change in the internal mg concentration over several hours. This shows that equilibration of both mg and mag - fura-2 across popc membranes is quite slow. We measured the transfer between ma : gmm ( 2:1 ) vesicles ( 2 mm amphiphile ) in the presence of 3.2 mm mgcl2. The rate ( k = 0.05 min ) and  amount of transfer ( 28% ) were not substantially affected by the  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 presence of mg. The surface area of vesicle growth can be monitored using nonexchanging fret dyes whose fluorescence depends on the surface density of the dyes.  pyrene fluorescence shifts from monomer to excimer if aggregates are present. Figure 3a shows growth of 2:1:0.3 ma : gmm : dodecane vesicles over time. A similar yield was obtained if 1 equiv of micelles was added at once or in up to five separate aliquots. The hammerhead ribozyme is widespread in nature and arises during in vitro selection for self - cleaving rnas. n15min7 was encapsulated in 2:1:0.3 ma : gmm : dodecane vesicles during amphiphile resuspension. multiple freezethaw cycles, used to equilibrate vesicle formation, did not affect self-cleavage activity. 60% of the rna was cleaved whether the ribo enzyme was encapsulate or free in solution. Table 2 shows unencapsulated ribozyme activity in 0.2 m bicine, ph 8.5 , 4 mm mgcl2. The top band corresponds to the uncleaved ribo enzyme; the bottom band is the cleavage product. The encapsulated reaction in 4 mm added mgcl1 was 5-fold higher than that in 1 mm addedmgcl2, according to the study. Ribozyme activity of ribozymes encapsulated in 2:1:0.3 vesicles ( 15 mm amphiphile) in 0.2 m bicine and 4 mm mgcl2. All radiolabeled n15min7 rna remained encapsulated 15 min after the addition of mgCl2. This decreased rate of self - cleavage of the encapsulated ribozyme may be partly due to the time scale of mg permeation into gmm - ma - dodecane vesicle. We confirmed that the 2:1:0.3 ma : gmm : dodecane mixture formed vesicles in the presence of mg and rna by fluorescence microscopy before extrusion. The self - cleavage rate of unencapsulated n15min7 upon addition of mg was not affected by  presence of vesicle. Currently available ribozymes with polymerase or ligase activity have much higher mg requirements. The class i ligase, discovered by in vitro evolution in the presence of high concentrations of mg, has a [ mg]1/2 of 70100 mm. The discrepancy between the mg requirement of this ribozyme and the mg  tolerance of the simple vesicles studied here suggests that observing ribo enzyme polymerase activity inside vesicle that can grow and divide may not be trivial in practice. An unexpected effect of mg was to increase the permeability of small , negatively charged solutes. This effect would be advantageous to an encapsulated replicating replicating rna that was polymerizing nucleic  acid monomers into longer strands of rna. Our results show that membranes made from simple amphiphiles can be stable enough to retain rna , yet dynamic enough to grow.',\n",
       " 'Palatal rugae ( plica palatinae transversae) refer to a series of transverse ridges on the anterior part of the palatal mucosa. These rugae are present on each side of the median palatal raphe and behind the incisive papillae. Palatal design and structure is not altered during growth and it is protected from external trauma. A double - blind study was conducted on orthodontic casts of patients who underwent treatment. The casts were distributed randomly among two observers for determination of sex and stability of rugae pattern. diverging pattern was found more commonly in females compared with males, who predominantly showed converging patterns. The changes occurring with extractions and tooth movement do not significantly alter the pattern of the palatal rugae. Palatal rugae pattern of an individual may be considered as a useful adjunct for identification purposes. The average number of rugae in females was slightly higher in comparison with that in males , and the diverging pattern was found more commonly in females compared with males. The patterns may be changed by different factors , such as wearing complete dentures , procedures that may cause trauma or cleft palate. Palatal rugae pattern remains unchanged after surgical intervention. patterns of rugae architecture are highly specific for the female and male populations. rugae morphological pattern may be useful in forensic science in case of mutilation when compared with other parts of the body. ease of reproducibility and lower level of variation makes palatal rugAE a potential tool in forensic odontology.',\n",
       " \" pectus excavatum is a condition in which the lower part of the sternum and the adjoining rib segments are sunken into the chest. As a result, the vital capacity of the lungs is reduced. The only effective method of treatment is surgery. The patient underwent a redo procedure in order to repair the recurrent chest deformity. Both sides of the chest was incised between the anterior and middle axillary lines. two implants were embedded under the sternum during the dissection. the patient was discharged from the lower silesian center for lung diseases in wrocaw. He was advised to report to his local surgery clinic for a postoperative control examination and suture removal. The patient was offered a personalized rehabilitation program aimed to improve the fitness of his circulatory and respiratory systems and to correct his posture. Three fundamental aspects were addressed by the therapeutic proceedings: morphological : to eliminate muscle dystonia and strengthen the muscular corset, physiological : to teach the patient to adopt the correct posture and form the habit of maintaining it, environmental : to ensure that the patient 's life conditions are conducive to eliminating the defect. Surgical treatment for pectus excavatum is a complex process requiring the cooperation of a medical team. The aim of these exercises was for the patient to learn how to breathe by increasing the vital capacity of the lungs. The mobility of the shoulder joints was increased, as was the strength of the dorsal , abdominal , and other postural muscles. Pectus excavatum is characterized by a reduction in the sagittal dimension of the chest. It is often accompanied by a displacement of the heart to the left, resulting in exercise tachycardia. 81.4% of patients report for the procedure due to cosmetic reasons and low self - acceptance.\",\n",
       " \"reproductive health programming for female sex workers ( fsw) has traditionally emphasized contraception and condom use for both pregnancy and hiv prevention. Fertility is of great importance in sub - saharan africa, and there is growing evidence that fsw desire children. To date limited attention has been given to safer pregnancy planning for fsw. The objective of this analysis is to assess fertility intentions and hiv among fsw as well as engagement in the hiv prevention , treatment , and care cascade. The study was conducted in two west african countries with key populations ( populations most at risk of hiv infection ) , including fsw and men who have sex with men. Study procedures for all enrolled participants included a cross - sectional sociobehavioral questionnaire and hiv counseling and rapid testing. All participants received pretest counseling and were counseled of the benefits of knowing one 's status. Participants could choose whether or not to receive their hiv test results. Between january and july 2013, 1,380 fsw were enrolled at study sites in burkina faso and togo. crude hiv prevalence among women enrolled was 19.2% ( 95% confidence interval ( ci ) 17.121.3 ) and ranged from 8.5% in ouagadougou to 31.9% in bobo - dioulasso. 267 out of the 1,349 fsw ( 19.8% ) reported that they were trying to become pregnant at the time of the study. Long - acting reversible methods ( larc ) of contraception were used by 24.8%. Report multiple nonpaying partners was the only risk behavior associated with hiv infection status among women trying to conceive. Around 12% of women reported unprotected anal sex with their non paying partners in the past month as well. Just over one - third of women had talked to their sexual partners about their hiv status. In togo 23.7% of hiv - infected fsw trying to conceive reported awareness of their status , as compared to 51.9% in burkina faso ( p = 0.02 ) art coverage among hiv- infected women was 13.2% in togo and 44.4% in Burkina Faso. The trend of higher fertility intentions among fsw living with hiv versus hiv. - uninfected fsw was seen across age strata ( 1824 years , 2535 years , and 36 years ) but only statistically significant among women aged 2535. Women reported being unaware that they were living with hiv. Large gaps in infection diagnosis resulted in low overall art coverage among hiv - infected fsw trying to conceive. Treatment coverage gaps were evident in both married / cohabitating and nonmarried women, as well as fsw who were already mothers and nonmothers. Unprotected sex is required to conceive, thus hiv transmission risks may be higher among women trying to conceive. We are not aware of any published hiv prevention studies which have provided fsw with safer conception services to minimize risk for hiv acquisition and transmission. These results suggest the need for this training to be integrated into both clinical hiv and family planning curricula for health care providers treating fsw. Our sample includes 1,349 fsw in burkina faso and togo who may be very different from other fsw not reached through the rds sampling methods. causal attribution of hiv transmission risks related to attempted conception can not be made from these cross - sectional data. information about disclosure to partners and the hiv status of fsw 's partners with whom they were trying to conceive was not collected.\",\n",

       " \" histamine inhibited the generation of il-4 and il-6 in total and mature cell  depleted lin bm cells. transcription of hdc , the gene that encodes the histamine - forming enzyme, also was diminished. histamine and h3/h4r ligands exert a similar inhibition on histamine. and cytokine production by bm basophils. Clobenpropit ( cb) inhibited histamine uptake and synthesis. mr 16155 and ciproxifan , two h3r antagonists were the most potent inhibitors. None of the drugs impaired cell viability, as assessed by trypan blue exclusion or colorimetric mtt assay. H4r mrna was expressed in basophil - enriched bm cells. blocking h1, h2, and h4 receptors did not prevent histamine uptake or inhibition of histamine and cytokine synthesis by the drugs. This ruled out the participation of any classical histamine receptor alone or in combination. decynium 22 ( d22 ) , -estradiol , and corticosterone . 2 b reduced uptake and synthesis of Histamine.  oct3 and oct1 mrnas are detected in basophil - enriched lin bm cells and sorted fcric - kit cells. The prototypical substrate of octs , mpp , is taken up by bm basophils and inhibited by d22 , cb , -estradiol , and histamine. tetraethylammonium , which recognizes human oct1 and oct2 , but not human oct3 , had no such effect. h incubation with cb significantly increased intracellular histamine levels in bm cells. Overall production and extracellular concentrations diminished. It is most likely due to a partial blockade of the outward transport after neosynthesis. oct3 ligands may synergize with histamine to enhance the susceptibility of basophils to the negative feedback.  histamine deficiency does not affect histamine uptake , and its inhibition by ciproxifan (cpf ) and cb ( data are means  sem from three separate experiments) Extracellular histamine levels were significantly lower in bm cells from mice that lacked oct3 than in controls ( fig . 4 d ) , as was total histamine production.  oct3 deficiency prevents the inhibitory effect of histamine , cb , and d22 on il-3induced il-6 production by bm cells. intracellular histamine is increased in bm Cells from oct3 mice. In contrast, histamine levels in supernatants as well as total histamine production are decreased. We postulate that oct3 participates in the control of. histamine and pro - th2 cytokine synthesis.  bm cells were prepared as reported ( 5 ) and adjusted to a final concentration of 2.5  10 per ml in culture medium ( mem ) supplemented with 10% horse serum ( all from gibco brl ) Various doses ( 1010 m ) of the drugs were added shortly before the addition of il-3 ( 1 ng / ml ) , followed by a 24-h incubation at 37c , 5% co2. basophils were identified by their fcrc - kit phenotype and were 98% pure upon reanalysis.

All faculty need to be encouraged , and indeed incentivized , to mentor a diverse group of potential scientists. One way to maintain urm student interest in stem fields is to expose them as early as possible to our research labs. programs like somas - urm provide funding for undergraduate students to work in junior faculty research labs providing mentoring to both student and faculty. i have noticed an exciting trend in the research questions that neuroscientists are tackling in their laboratories. more of our research projects seem to be addressing issues that may be of particular interest to students from disadvantaged groups. i think we need to be honest about the fact that some students ( students of all racial and ethnic groups ) will simply not be able to succeed at our institutions. i wonder why we have not made greater progress in determining what level of achievement is necessary in order to increase the likelihood of success for all of our students. if there is a good reason to think that the markers of such achievement are different for different groups , make the argument , use those markers , and let s get going.

       " 'aki is associated with short - term morbidity , a long - term risk of chronic kidney disease ( ckd ) and cardiovascular events and decreases survival. Common functional markers such as serum creatinine or urine output are late indicators of aki. There are numerous potential strategies that could be deployed to mitigate aki if sufficient warning was provided. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 ( timp-2) and insulin - like growth factor - binding protein 7 ( igfbp7) were used in the sapphire study. The primary end point was moderate - severe aki [ kidney disease : improving global outcomes ( kdigo ) stage 23 ] within 12 h of sample collection.  urinary [ timp-2] performed well to predict severe aki in critically ill patients with and without sepsis with a roc auc range of 0.810 to 0.84. The main purpose of the test would be to identify the majority of high - risk patients, and to ensure all such patients receive these recommended actions. Opal study enrolled 154 critically ill adults from six sites in the united states. 27 subjects met the primary end point ( stage 23 aki within 12 h ) The results of the opal study replicated those of sapphire ( figure  2 ) where the sensitivity at the 0.3 cutoff was 89% , and npv was 97% . for 2.0 , specificity was 95% and ppv was 49% . relative risk of aki for subjects testing in each strata is shown in figure 2. The urinary [ timp-2][igfbp7 ] test significantly improved risk assessment by stratifying patients into distinct risk categories. There was a 7-fold increase in risk for patients with a test value of 0.3 compared with those 0.2 to 0.4. Using a multivariate model including clinical information, urinary [Timp-Two] remained statistically significant and a strong predictor. Patients included in three large multi - center trials evaluating cell - cycle arrest markers. Taken together the results of these studies of urinary [ timp-2][igfbp7 ] should enable early triage and risk stratification in a wide range of critically ill patients. Both timp-2 and igfbp7 may increase in response to a wide variety of insults ( inflammation , oxidative stress , ultraviolet radiation , drugs and toxins ) [ 2123 ] This may help explain why they correspond to risk for aki. These insults may not actually destroy cells and these molecules appear to be able to signal in autocrine and paracrine fashions. The test was designed to risk assess for stage 23 aki. The biomarker concentrations correspond to severity of aki across all three stages. The markers do not appear to persist in the urine for long after aki has occurred. The cutoffs for the test are based on overall behavior of the biomarkers in the majority of patients. Anyone regardless of clinical risk assessment should be considered to be at high risk. The cell uses cell - cycle arrest as a protective mechanism to avoid cell - division when potentially damaged. If epithelial cells remain arrested in g1 or g2 , it favors a hypertrophic and fibrotic phenotype. Cell - cycle arrest is a protective mechanism to avoid the cell entering the cell - cycle when it is injured or even in an adverse environment. Temporary g1 cell- cycle arrest should reduce kidney damage. A single dose given 18 h after cecal ligation and puncture and along with initial antibiotics was successful in reducing aki. There is a growing appreciation for the concept of secondary injury to the kidney as danger signaling molecules ( damage and pathogen - associated molecular patterns ) are delivered to the renal tubule via both glomerular filtration and the blood stream. These molecules are detected by pattern recognition receptors on the tubular cell surface where they initiate a cascade leading to inflammation and/or apoptosis.',\n",
       " 'gastric cancer contains 10% of cancers in the world and is one of the most common kinds of cancers. The elementary treatment of gastric cancer in initial stages is surgery ; so it is considered as the prime treatment for cancer. chemotherapy and radiotherapy will be used as supplementary treatments , if necessary. the odds of patients complete recovery depend on the surgery but the time when the disease passes through the mucous membrane. Cox model is often called proportional hazards model. for the survival time. It is the most helpful model in analyzing survival data. efficiency of the model is severely dependent to proportional hazards assumption. in occasions where the proportional hazard model is not acceptable, estimates derived from cox model will lead to incorrect inferences.  akaike information criterion ( aic) is used to measure the goodness of models fitness. The smaller the aic is, the more efficacious the model will be in identifying the risk factors. Stata 11 software was used for all analyses and the significance level was set at 5%. Cox proportional hazard model and accelerated failure - time models ( except log - logistic and log - normal ) do not show much difference in terms of variables significance. The exponential and gompertz models had better results according to akaike information criterion. Only variables of age ( at diagnosis ) , marital status , relapse , number of supplementary treatments , disease stage , and type of surgery are among the effective factors on the survival of patients with gastric cancer.  accelerated failure - time models consider a statistical distribution for survival time and they do not need proportional hazards assumption ( ph ) These models are suitable alternatives to proportional hazard model. Age, marital status, relapse, number of supplementary treatments, disease stage and type of surgery were among the effective factors on the survival of patients with gastric cancer ( p < 0.05 )  exponential and gompertz models are the best parametric alternatives for cox proportional hazard model. Results of accelerated failure - time models have often been more valid and have had minor bias since these models have better fitness in similar conditions. When empirical information is adequate , accelerated failure-time models can prepare some insights into the form of the baseline hazard. ethical issues ( including plagiarism , informed consent , misconduct , data fabrication and/or falsification ) have been completely observed.',\n",
       " 'tuberous sclerosis is a rare multisystem disorder characterized by widespread hamartomas in several organs.

To our knowledge, only 13 cases of pancreatic ict with tuberous sclerosis have been reported. 63-year - old woman with abdominal pain diagnosed with angiomyolipoma of the kidney and liver and islet cell tumor of the pancreas. Diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis established on the basis of radiologic findings of renal and hepatic aml , calcified subependymal nodules , and vertebral sclerotic lesions. Tuberous sclerosis is a rare autosomal dominant disorder which can affect almost all body systems. It is caused by the mutation of two tumor suppressor genes, tsc1 and tsc2. The tuberin - hamartin complex has been shown to be critical for controlling cell growth and proliferation. The majority of the legions in tuberous sclerosis are benign hamartomas, which rarely become malignant. Pancreatic involvement in the form of cysts , aml , or ict is very rare in tuberous sclerosis. Genetic syndromes associated with icts include multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 and von hippel - lindau disease. Nonfunctioning icts represent approximately one - half of all documented icts. Liver metastases of icts are also usually hypervascular and appear as hyperattenuating masses in the arterial phase images on ct.

       " 'The relatively high prevalence of obesity and overweight in black females begins early in life. Higher levels of general and visceral adiposity are associated with poor cardiometabolic biomarker profiles. Black females are also at greater risk of exhibiting unfavorable levels of obesity - related cardiometric biomarkers. A recent review of the literature found evidence that pa leads to favorable changes in biomarker profile in obese youths. We found in previous studies that accepting only one sibling per family resulted in eligible and interested potential subjects refusing participation. Therefore, we decided to accept sisters to increase study acceptability on the part of subjects and their parents. Subjects came to the georgia prevention institute ( gpi ) for testing at the beginning of the study and after 10  mo.  insulin was assayed in duplicate 100  ul aliquots of sera by specific radioimmunoassay ( linco research inc . , st . charles , mo ) ; cross - reactivity with proinsulin is less than 0.2% . Assay sensitivity was 3.41  uu / ml ; intra - assay coefficient of variation was3.7% . Plasma concentrations of apolipoprotein(apo)a1 , apob , and lipoprotein(a ) ( lp(a) ) were determined using immunoturbidimetric methods. Two indices of aerobic fitness were obtained : maximal oxygen consumption ( vo2 max ) and oxygen consumption at a hr of 170  bpm ( vo1 - 170) subjects were considered to have attained vo2max if they met two of the following three criteria. Only about half of the subjects who attained vo1 max at baseline also did so at postintervention. Using vo2 Max as our index of fitness would have resulted in a 50% decrease in sample size for the analyses. Ancova was performed to identify significant effects of the intervention on changes from baseline while adjusting for baseline values. relationships of biomarkers with indices of fatness and fitness at baseline were analyzed using spearman rank correlations to account for the nonnormal distributions of some of the variables. higher levels of the fatness indices were significantly associated with less favorable levels of all of the biomarkers except diastolic bp. There were no significant differences between groups at baseline for any of the biomarkers. greater improvements in fitness were significantly associated with greater increases in hdlc and lesser changes in fibrinogen. The highest correlation coefficients were shown for the relations between increases in vat and increases in crp and fibr inogen. There was a significant negative relationship between pa - attendance and change in BMI. Children in georgia have been shown to be heavier than the national average. baseline values of the cardiometabolic biomarkers fell largely within normal ranges for girls in the 812 y range of age. higher aerobic fitness was associated with more favorable levels of several of the biomarkers. Favorable decreases in resting hr and ldlc were seen in the intervention group. Changes in total cholesterol and crp following the intervention were marginally significant ( p < 0.10 ) These results suggest that beneficial changes in some cardiometabolic biomarkers may occur with pa even within children whose levels are relatively normal. Results are consistent with the suggestion that visceral adiposity is an especially important influence on some aspects of cardiometabolic health. A 10-mo intervention that had favorable effects on body composition and fitness had significant effects on only a small number of biomarkers. More research is needed in which various doses of pa are imparted to youths over periods of several years to uncover the long - term relations of fatness and fitness to cardiometric health in youths.',\n",
       " \"muscle atrophy ( reduced muscle bulk ) is a nonspecific sign. It may occur as a consequence of muscle disuse , tendon tear , or denervation. fatty infiltration ( replacement of muscle fibers by fat ) is mostly seen in association with massive rotator cuff tear. suprascapular nerve ( ssn ) injury associated with traumatic shoulder dislocation is most likely due to a traction injury to the nerve. Non - operative treatment failed to alleviate the patient 's shoulder instability. Therefore, she underwent arthroscopic bankart repair. The patient followed a post - bankart rehabilitation program. At two - year follow - up, she reported no more instability in her left shoulder. The true incidence of the isolated supraspinatus muscle denervation and fatty degeneration in the absence of tendon tear remains unknown. The infrasp inatus muscle is used as a reference for ssn injury in emg study. We propose three potential explanations for this rare phenomenon. The short tether motor branches to the suprasparatus muscle are more prone to injury as compared to the longer and larger motor branches. The axillary nerve may give a branch to the long head of triceps and ( or ) the infrasperatus muscles.  associated rotator cuff tear and fatty infiltration had a negative influence on the outcome of ssn injury after shoulder dislocation. The fatty degeneration associated with traumatic peripheral nerve injury is likely to be irreversible. The time of onset and progression of the fatty infiltration after traumatic muscle denervation is still unclear yet.\",\n",

The 13.9% of patients ( 21 ears ) complained of earFullness, 80.8% of. patients ( 122 ears ) reported tinn Titus , and 52.3% ( 79 ears ) of patients reported vertigo. The percentages of patients in complete recovery , partial recovery , slight recovery or slight recovery (0.% ) failed. Bilateral hearing loss and severe to profound hearing loss had statistically significant differences between the recovered and no - recovered groups. presence of tinnitus , early treatment , and female had a positive correlation with hearing recovery. The other factors had no significant difference between the recovery and no-recovery groups. Cssnhl usually occured unilaterally ( 80.1% ) in neonates. The most common types were flat ( 23.2% ) and profound ( 57.0% ) The distribution of age in relation to gender, ear fullness, vertigo, audiogram curve types and initial degree of hearing loss had no statistical difference. Cochlear microcirculation is extremely vulnerable to thrombosis , reduced blood flow , and vascular occlusion. infection by virus in cssnhl may cause thromBosis , damage of vessels , and peripheral blood leukocyte effusion. increased white blood cell ( wbc ) count had a close relationship with the onset of ssnhl. plt results may justify further research into the use of thrombolytic drugs. innitus , ascending type audiogram , gender , identifiable abr - waves , and dpoaes were positive prognostic factors regarding hearing recovery in cssnhl. The presence of tinnitus was determined to be a positive factor associated with hearing recovery. The level of wbc , plt , homocysteine , alp , positive cmv igg antibody , fibrinogen , and some immunologic indicators were closely related to cssNhl. This study was financially supported by grants from the national key basic research program of china.\",\n",
       " \"metanephric stromal tumour ( mst) was first described in 2000 by argani et al. There have been only five case reports of this tumour in the english literature. Its recognition is essential as it spares the patient from unnecessary potentially toxic adjuvant chemotherapy. Mst is thought to be related to wilm 's tumour unlike other renal stromal tumours such as cmn , ccsk and rhabdoid tumour of kidney. mst is differentiated from cmn by its scalloped , subtly infiltrative border. Our case did not show heterologous differentiation , angiodysplasia of the vessel wall or juxta glomerular cell hyperplasia. Mst is an abdominal mass followed by hematuria, recurrent urinary tract infection ( uti ) , incontinence, fever , anemia and hypertension. In one case continous extension through bladder into the prostatic urethra has been reported. Most msts were previously classified as congenital mesoblastic nephroma until recently.\",\n",

       " \"Despite clinical blindness , some patients retain nonconscious visual abilities for processing unseen stimuli in the blind hemifield. Two kinds of strategies have been typically employed to assess blindsight : direct and indirect methods. The former makes use of forced - choice paradigms where the subjects make an explicit decision regarding unseen attributes of the stimulus presented to them. The latter uses perceptual completion requirements ( torjussen , 1978)  indirect methods most often used for testing blindsight are the redundant target effect ( rte) and the tachistoscopic presentation of two or more synchronous stimuli to both visual hemifields. The main advantage of indirect methods is that patients make a choice about visual attributes they do not consciously acknowledge without being forced to do so. The superior colliculus ( sc) is necessary and sufficient for the rte to occur. This raises the interesting possibility that the sc responds differentially to higher - order perceptual properties. The relative contribution of the sc could not be disentangled from that of the other subcortical centers or their extrastriate targets. The sc specific role remains unresolved.  patient dr is a right - handed woman ( 40 years old at the time of testing ) who presented with left hemiparesis since birth and began suffering from epileptic seizures at the age of 5 years. cognitive testing indicated borderline intelligence scores : full scale intelligence quotient ( fisq ) , 77 ; verbal iq, 92 and performance iq , 65 . at the same age , she underwent a functional hemispherectomy, which consisted of removing the temporal lobe including the mesial structures , the amygdala , the hippocampus and a frontal - parietal corticectomy. At the age of 25 he underwent surgery to remove the congenital porencephalic cyst and a temporal - parietal - occipital lobectomy to alleviate intractable seizures. neuropsychological testing revealed an fsiq of 78 ; verbal iq of 80 and performanceiq of 79. follow - up cognitive testing showed an increase in iq to an average range of 99. contralateral hemianopia without macular sparing was confirmed by computerized perimetry. The patients were tested monocularly with the ( left ) contralesional eye while an eye patch covered the ( right ) ipsilesional eye. stimuli were projected on a 17 lcd monitor ( refresh rate : 16.7  hz ) using a macbook pro notebook with exposure duration of 80  ms ( 5 refresh rates ) The participants were required to maintain fixation on a small black circle in the center of the screen and to refrain from moving their eyes. The stimuli were presented in two blocks , each containing 84 randomized trials. within each block , the six stimulation conditions and display types were equiprobable. Each was repeated for 14 trials ( unilateral : single, quadruple gestalt - like , quadruple random ; bilateral : single , quadple gestal - like, quadple random ) in total, each patient received 28 stimulus presentations per condition. mean rts as a function of the six stimulus conditions are shown separately for patient dr and se in fig . visual inspection reveals that rts decreased in bilateral compared to unilateral presentations irrespective of the different display types. Patient dr showed a significant main effect of presentation condition. configuration factor revealed that rts were significantly faster for gestalt - like patterns than for either single or quadruple random dot shapes. In unilateral trials the stimuli were projected in the patients ' intact hemifield and any effect potentially observed thus reflects sensitivity for consciously seen stimuli. conversely, in bilateral displays a stimulus was added in the blind hem ifield.  patient se displayed a significant main effect of presentation condition. The rts for gestalt - like configurations were significantly faster than for either single or random patterns, but only in bilateral trials. Dr was differentially responsive to gestalt like configurations only when the stimuli were projected bilaterally, and hence to his blind hemifield as well. In the present study , we investigated the sensitivity of two blindsight patients with hemispherectomy to stimulus perceptual organization when the display is presented to the blind hemifield. We found that there was a rte specific for gestalt - like stimulus configurations but not for spatially random patterns. These findings confirm and extend previous observations in patients with blindsight following lesions restricted to portions of the visual cortex. balanced for each of the two display types. gestalt - like and random patterns were randomly intermingled and presented within the same block of trials. this new procedure also rules out the possibility that the original findings were partly due to fatigue or habituation determining the lack of effect for random patterns. while both patients exhibited similar overall results , they differed in that dr showed a speeding up of rts also when gestalt- like patterns were presented unilaterally in her intact hemifield. The sc is a phylogenetically ancient visual structure considered to have coarse retinotopy. Recent neurophysiological evidence as well as previously somewhat overlooked findings from single - cell recordings in monkeys and rats clearly indicate otherwise. The sc is able to represent complex stimulus configurations and respond differentially to a gestalt - like perceptual organization. The sc seems to participate in early stages of figure - ground segmentation and the combined interaction of m and k channels can enable encoding of complex and high - level properties of the visual input. The preserved sensitivity for gestalt - like configuration observed here despite right hemispherectomy could arise from the sc mirroring lateralized functions reported primarily at the cortical level.\",\n",
       " 'colorectal cancer ( crc) is a leading cause of cancer - related deaths in the world. More than 1.2 million patients are diagnosed with crc every year. Early diagnosis for crc still remains difficult and the overall survival rate of crc patients has not changed dramatically.  mir-429 expression levels in primary tissues and serum from crc patients were determined. The potential diagnostic and prognostic value in patients receiving 5-fu - based chemotherapy was also investigated. The results indicated that mir -429 expression was significantly downregulated in crc. patients receiving first - line 5 -fu -based treatment. Primary crc tissues were synthesized from 200 ng extracted total rna. Plasma rna was extracted by using acid phenol according to the manufacturer s instructions. The survival curves of crc patients were estimated via the kaplan - meier method. The association between tissue and plasma mirna levels was analyzed using the spearman s correlation coefficient. All patients received standardized follow - up including ct - scans of the chest and abdomen at 12 months and 36 months after surgery. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients according to local ethical regulations of the ethics committee of the second people s hospital of hefei city. The survival curves of crc patients were estimated via the kaplan - meier method and the difference in survival curves was estimated using log - rank testing.  mir-429 expression was significantly increased in tumor tissues compared with paired normal tissues ( p<0.001 , figure 1a ) . moreover, the mir- 429 expression in 60.3% ( 47 of 78 ) cases were 2-fold higher than in adjacent tissues ( figure 1b ) mir-430 expression was positively correlated with tnm stage, lymph node metastasis , distant metastasis and tumor size. No correlations were observed between mir-428 expression and age , sex , tumor location , and differentiation.  mir-429 expression was significantly higher in patients who did not respond to treatment ( n=42 ) compared with patients responding to treatment. The 5-year survival rate of the crc patients whose tumors expressed high levels of mir- 429 was 35.9% ( 14/39 ) , which was significantly lower than that of the patients whose. tumors expressed low levels of the marker ( 66.7% )  mir-429 levels were 0.721 ( 95% ci : 0.6300.800 , figure 3c ) , and the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity reached 52.70% and 85.71% , respectively. The proportion of patients not responding to chemotherapy was significantly higher in the high mir- 429 expressing group than in the low group. The 5-year survival rate of the crc patients whose tumors expressed high levels of mir-423 was 21.4%. cancerous tissues , and our results indicated that the expression of mir-429 was significantly increased in tumor tissues compared with paired normal tissues ( p<0.001 , figure 1a ) . moreover , the mir- 429 expression in 60.3% ( 47 of 78 ) cases were 2-fold higher than in adjacent tissues ( figure 1b) mir-430 expression was positively correlated with tnm stage, lymph node metastasis , distant metastasis and tumor size. These results suggest that high expression of Mir-429 may participate in the carcinogenesis of crc.  mir-429 expression was significantly higher in patients who did not respond to treatment ( n=42 ) compared with patients responding to treatment. The 5-year survival rate of the crc patients whose tumors expressed high levels of mir- 429 was 35.9% ( 14/39 ) , which was significantly lower than that of the patients who had low levels of the drug ( 66.7% , 26/39)  mir-429 is an oncogene involved in the development in early stages of malignancies. It is reported to promote tumor progression in pancreatic cancer. micrornas can regulate 30% of the protein coding genes in the human genome. Despite recent chemotherapeutic regimens that have significantly increased survival, nearly all crc patients finally become chemo - resistant.  mirna expression level in peripheral blood to diagnose tumors early is effective and deserves to be explored further. mirna is very stable in blood plasma and serum. mir-429 was an oncogene regulated by evodiamine and berberine in human crc. mirnas are critical for understanding the roles of mirnas in tumorigenesis and may be important for defining novel therapeutic targets. High mir-429 expression levels in crc tissues and serum was associated with enhanced malignant potential and poor prognosis of crc patients. overexpression of mir -429 might be involved in 5-fu resistant phenotypes of human crcs. Future studies with a large cohort of samples based on a multi - center , randomized controlled trial are needed to help identify potential clinical applications.',\n",
       " 'Intraabdominal desmoplastic small round cell tumors ( dsrct) are rare , but aggressive mesenchymal malignancies of uncertain origin. It usually presents with symptoms of abdominal pain, weight loss, nausea, vomiting , and a palpable abdominal mass. Since primary gastrointestinal ( gi ) malignancy are rare in children , the mass - forming dsrCT mimicking a gi tract tumor is difficult to diagnose before a laparotomy. The survival prognosis following the diagnosis is an average of 23 months. systemic chemotherapy has been used as the initial treatment along with debulking surgery. Whether it is worth sacrificing major organs such as the liver and pancreas for cytoreductive surgery in patients with dsrct is debatable. Tumors are likely now in a refractory phase and will soon show rapid disease progression , eventually leading to the death of this patient. although post - operative chemotherapy was provided and the patient is now alive with residual disease , the prognosis is dismal. the target genes is related to the invasiveness of the dsrct.',\n",
       " 'oral health is fundamental to general health and well being , significantly impacting on quality of life. bad oral health may have a negative impact on appearance, ability to eat and communication with people. regular tooth brushing with fluoride toothpaste can reduce dental conditions of tooth decay and periodontal disease. A survey performed in lithuania among 373 adolescents showed that majority of them ( 73.7%) brush teeth two times a day or more often. Two child care homes were selected out of five in the city as the remaining three lacked participants. 68 participants ( 32 of practical application group and 36 of motivation group ) were enrolled into this study. Children were asked to complete a self - administered questionnaire at the baseline and at the study end. Intervention was applied in children care home by means of five lectures prepared by one of the authors ( g. m. ) lectures were read once every three weeks and used simple language and explained scientific issues plainly and clearly to make it easy for children to understand. evaluation of the intervention after 3 month 54 children were examined clinically and scored for pli. All children had a plaque on at least one tooth in both groups. Older children had poorer oral hygiene. No statistically significant difference between age groups determined. Girls oral hygiene status 0.86 was significantly better than boys 1.28 ( 0.45 ) ( p < 0.001) More boys ( 61%) than girls ( 33%) brush their teeth less than twice a day. . regular tooth brushing is important in having healthy teeth stated 82.9% ( n = 29 ) of 7 - 12 year- olds and 97% (N = 32 ) of 13 - 17 year - olds. within the last 12 months : 77.1% of children of age 7 -12 years and 90.9%. visited dentist. Most of the orphans visited dentist for check up 45.2% while few of respondents for orthodontic treatment 4.8% (n = 3) After the study oral hygiene improvement was higher for boys 0.75 ( 0.39 ) than girls 0.56 (0.37 ) , but statistically insignificant ( p = 0.09 ) . questionnaire after 3 months intervention children s tooth brushing habits did not change statistically significant between both training groups. tooth brushing frequency statistically significantly changed among girls in comparison with the boys ( p < 0.001) Oral hygiene of all children at a baseline was 1.11 ( 0.46 ) and significantly better among girls than the boys ( p < 0.001 ) It has been proven that brushing skills get better with age and that the duration of brushing is significant for oral hygiene of children as well. Short term research and educational programs , taking a period of 3 months , are effective to measure positive changes in oral hygiene. The 3 month research program performed in iran showed increased quality of oral hygiene not only in intervention group , but control group as well. It is also known that practice without sufficient motivation can show only temporarily positive results. Oral hygiene educational programs in schools are efficient in teaching kids to properly take care of their oral hygiene. Programs should include both practical and motivational teaching to have the best possible outcome for the longest possible time. Years spent at school are greatly influential for human being , meaning that habits of oral health are developed for the rest of one s life.',\n",
       " ' 97% consensus is that our planet is heating up at an accelerated rate. This is caused by the rapid increase in carbon dioxide ( co2 ) concentration in the atmosphere. The contribution of co2 to the greenhouse effect can easily be estimated to be about 3.6%.  climate scientists are basing their conclusions mainly on research of the so - called finite - elements type. Such systems are complicated, but by tuning the processes and parameters that are part of the simulations they manage to explain the actual climate data to an impressive accuracy. Yet , the problem with such simulations is that even if they do simulate the past , no insight is gained into the system unless the simulations themselves are analyzed. Since 1998 , the hottest year in recent history , the planet has actually been cooling. This was not foreseen by the predictions of 2007 where a continuing exponential increase in temperature was forecasted. The scientific community is now going back to its drawing boards and fine - tunes its models to new perfection. Time lag of co2 to vostok temperature of ( 600  400 ) yr during early deglacial changes in the last 3 transitions glacial - interglacial. This is inexplicable in the framework of global warming models and we honestly start having some legitimate doubts. If the correlations are true, something is still not correct. Methane ch4 shows the same correlation with [ co2 ] and t. This leaves us flabbergasted . we know that methane is also a strong climate - forcing greenhouse agent. The enigma is , how did the information from the co2 variations percolate to [ ch4 ] variations ? We looked at the recent historic climate data ( from just before the agw model prevalence ) and meticulously measured [ co2 ] data and came to the same conclusion , as we will present here. At the onset of the global warming ideas , no warming was observed that can be correlated to the ( accelerated ) increase of [ co 2 ] . note also that since 1998 it has not warmed up at all , as confirmed by satellite data. In the northern hemisphere  where more people live  is cold and humans thus burn more fuel to warm their houses , i.e. , [ co2 ] is a function of temperature. Other long - term processes such as degassing of oceans can have opposite effects , that is, warmer  more co2 . while we bear this in mind , we will continue the reasoning of anthropogenic global warming and assume an opposite correlation. We will model our climate system with a simple electronic relaxation system. This system consists of a resistance and a capacitance. The product of the two yields the relaxation time ,  =rc. This is necessarily a simple relaxation system where the changes of the force cause the system to be off - equilibrium until a new equilibrium is reached. Solar radiation and temperature oscillate with one year period, but the warmest day is nearly everywhere one month after the day with the most daylight. The on average coldest day in the solar radiation and climate system is one month later. The relaxation time of the { radiation  temperature } system therefore must be about 0.1 year ( 1.2 months ) Many climate scientists have proposed positive feedbacks as discussed in the introduction and they make heavy use of them in order to explain and model the needed nonlinear behavior of the greenhouse effect. In standard theory, if earth warms up ( by global warming in a radiation imbalance ) , the temperature rises and the outward earth radiation increases by a certain amount until establishing a new equilibrium. In the agw model, a positive feedback of the the following form is used : if the temperature increases , the outward Earth radiation is less than that predicted by standard theory. The climate is a negative - feedback system that stabilizes itself. Had the earth climate been a positive - Feedback system the temperature would have been in a runaway situation. If starting oscillations are much faster than the response time of the system the effective amplitude is reduced. In a runaway system they will be amplified up to the point of saturation. If the system is unstable ( positive feedback ) , the system will run away. Such negative feedback will make any delay longer than 1/4 period impossible. It is highly unlikely that the natural frequency of the climate-[co2 ] system is close to the 12-month - periodic driving force.

       " \"Najarian and sutherland transplanted islets in nondiabetic recipients who were their own donors and reported reproducible successes beginning in 1980. The transplants normalized glycemia in rats previously made diabetic by streptozotocin injection. If over 300,000 autoislets could be transplanted , the success rate of preventing diabetes for more than 2 years was 74% ( 5) The edmonton approach was to use an average of two sequential islet transplants to establish normoglycemia. over time , however , the successes enjoyed by the edmonton group began to slowly diminish. Only 4 of 18 subjects ( 22% ) were successful at sites where there was a history of less than four transplantations previously. Alloislet transplantation can be considered largely successful at 1 year with a decline thereafter to an average success rate ( insulin - independence and at least nearly normal glycemia ) of 50% at various times during the 2nd year. The answer to this question is in the eye of the beholder . to the skeptic 's eye , the procedure looks interesting , but is replete with problems. Alloislet transplantation shows promise of providing c - peptide positivity, nearly normal a1c levels , and strikingly fewer episodes of hypoglycemia for as long as 5 years. pancreas transplantation enjoys virtually no patient mortality attributable to the surgery and an average of 80% success 3 years post - transplantation. A major deficiency of virtually all published studies of islet transplantation is the lack of a suitable control group of medically managed patients. The Edmonton series of alloislet transplants for the years 20002005 compared favorably with the success rate of pancreas transplants in 19841987. The sole study that did include a medically managed control group was reported by thompson et al ( 36 ) The number of islets transplanted correlates very well with the magnitude of insulin responses to several stimulii ( 39 ) It seems very likely that the number of healthy , transplanted islets is significantly overestimated. This means the recipients may not have received the stated goal of 6,000 healthy islets / kg body mass. mia for many years ( 40,41) . an important difference is that islets used for autoislet transplantation are not purified and undergo much less stress pretransplantation. One answer to the alloislet problem may be to eliminate the cold centrifugation step ( 42 ) . cold centrifUGation minimizes the total tissue mass used to infuse islets into the liver. i believe the use of liver should be reconsidered and a new look should be given to other sites first examined in 1972 but passed over for human use. preclinical literature supports consideration of celiac artery, intravenous access to lung, intrapancreas, intramuscular, subcutaneous, thymus, testis, intracisterna magna, omental pouches. This practice at best relates only to whether the islets are alive or dead and imparts little about their degree of functionality. What is needed is assessment of glucose - induced insulin secretion by either static or perifusion protocols. These approaches would provide much more sophisticated information about the donor islets used for human transplantation. Cold centrifugation minimizes the total tissue mass used to infuse islets into the liver. This is thought to lessen the likelihood of complications such as hepatic portal hypertension or lobar infarction. The liver is the site where ingested environmental toxins accumulate. It is also where orally administered immunosuppressive drugs are concentrated. i believe the use of liver should be reconsidered and a new look should be given to other sites first examined in 1972 but passed over for human use. preclinical literature supports consideration of celiac artery, intravenous access to lung, intrapancreas, intramuscular, subcutaneous, thymus, testis, intracisterna magna and kidney capsule. Hyperglycemia is accompanied by a 50% death rate within 5 years of diagnosis. Successful pancreas transplantation converts this death rate from 50 to 10%. Our experiences with islet transplantation have taught us lessons that will be important for the use of -cell surrogates , be they stem cell derivatives or modified cell lines.\",\n",
       " 'Honey has some minor constituents compared to its major sugar level, which is believed to have antioxidant properties. polyphenols and phenolic acids found in the honey vary according to the geographical and climatic conditions. We summarized the compositional chemistry and antiproliferative potential of crude honey and some of its important polyphenol compounds in various cancer cells. Honey bees make a journey of nearly 55,000 miles to gather nectar from approximately 2 million flowers for accumulating one pound of honey. honey mainly composed of sugars and water which accounts roughly 79.6% and 17.2% , respectively. honey minor constituents include acids, protein, nitrogen, amino acids, minerals and a number of other minute quantities of components like pigments and aroma substances. Honey possessing higher phenolic and tryptophan content was more potent in inhibiting the colon cancer cell proliferation. honey induced apoptosis was associated with caspase-3 activation and parp cleavage. honey was proven to be a very effective agent for repressing the growth of bladder cancer cell lines ( t24 , rt4 , 253j , and mbt-2 ) in vitro.  flavonoids constitute the most important polyphenolic class with more than 5000 compounds already described. polyphenols found in the honey was used as a marker for particular type of honey. hydroxy - cinnamates like caffeic acid , ferulic acid and p - coumaric acid have been found in chest - nut honey. The incidence of fore - stomach papillomas was significantly increased only in the combination group. The effect on the other organs particularly colon tumors was evaluated. The growth inhibitory effect of these compounds was measured after exposing cells for a period of 48 days. ca exhibited significant toxicity only at above 2500 m concentration. in colon cancer cell line ( ht-29) the cytotoxicity effect of ca , pec , pedmc and mc was evaluated .  ca was found to be the least effective in inhibiting the growth of ht-29 cells when compared to its ester analogs. synthesis of polynucleotide and protein synthesis after incubating the ht -29 cells with these agents for 48 hours were investigated. at the concentration of 175 m of mc , 40 m of pec and 60 m of pedmc blocked the dna , rna and the protein synthesis. Pec diet significantly repressed the aom - induced lipoxygenase metabolites 8(s)- and 12(s)hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid ( hete) animals fed the mc diet exhibited a moderate inhibitory effect on odc and 5(s- , 8(S)- , 12(S- )hetes. acf were significantly inhibited in the animals fed with pec ( 55% ) , pemc ( 82% ) or pedmc ( 81% ) cape at 1. significantly inhibited aom- induced odc  and tpk activities in liver and colon. Cape is a potent inhibitor of dna synthesis but it is somewhat less effective in inhibiting rna synthesis and it is least effective in inhibition of protein synthesis. cape inhibited the tnf - dependent activation of nf-b in a dose - dependent manner with maximum effect occurring at 25 g / ml. It prevented the translocation of p-65 subunit of n f-b to the nucleus without affecting the t nf - induced ib degradation. 24 hours treatment with cape ( 50 m ) . facs analysis of cape - treated c6 glioma cells showed increasing accumulation of hypodiploid nuclei ( 24% at 36 hour ) in time - dependent fashion. cape induced the release of cytochome - c from mitochondria into the cytosol after 3 hours of treatment resulting in the activation of caspase-3. Cape inhibited the enzymatic activity of mmp-9 that plays an important role in cancer invasion and metastasis. cape also inhibited the cell invasion , cell migration and colony formation of tumor cells. cape acts as a vital antimetastatic agent, by inhibiting the metastatic and invasive potential of malignant cells. Chrysin (5 , 7-dihydroxyflavone) is a natural and biologically active compound extracted from honey , plants and propolis. It possesses potent antiinflammatory , antioxidant properties and promotes cell death by perturbing cell cycle progression. In an antiproliferation assay performed on c6 glioma cells , chrysin inhibited the cell proliferation after 24, 48 and 72 hours. Chrysin exerts its growth - inhibitory effects either through activating p38-mapk leading to the accumulation of p21 protein or through mediating the inhibition of proteosome activity. In another study by woo et al . reported the chrysin - mediated apoptosis in u-937 cancer cell lines. -bromo-5-hydroxy-7-methoxychrysin have the strongest activities against sgc-7901 and ht-29 cells respectively. The compound 5 , 7-dihydroxy-8-nitro chrysin was found to have strong activities against both sGC-7900 and hT-29.  quercetin showed remarkable inhibitory effect on the activities of cytosolic protein kinase c ( pkc ) and membrane tpk of hl-60 cells in vitro. after 1 hour exposure to the drug it resulted in apoptosis. side scatter changes were predominantly observed after 24 hours and 72 hours incubation with 100 m galangin.  quercetin exerted both antioxidant and pro - oxidant properties depending upon the concentration used. The lower concentration ( 10 m ) produced increased number of live cells , repressing the number of cells in the apoptotic and necrotic portions. On the other hand if the concentration was above 50 m , it reduced the number\\xa0of live cells by increasing the\\xa0apoptotic\\xa0and\\xa0necrotic fractions. Quercetin showed inhibitory effect on breast cancer cell ( mda - mb-435 ) in a time and dose dependent manner. hsu et al . investigated the antiproliferative effect of acacetin in human liver cancer cell line ( hepg2 ) The maximum inhibitory Effect ( nearly 72% ) was observed at a concentration 20 g / ml after 48 hours. acetin increased the induction of p53 and its downstream target, p21/waf1 as assayed by enzyme linked immuno - sorbent assay ( elisa ) They concluded that p53 may participate in the antiproliferative activity of acacetin in hepg2 and a549 cells. explored the significance of kaempferol induced apoptosis in human lung nonsmall carcinoma cells. A decrease in the mitochondrial potential followed by enhanced expression of active caspase-3 was observed. The early prenecrotic phase of apoptosis was only observed for a minor proportion of cells treated with 20 m kaempferol. The initial trigger for mitochondrial apoptosis appears to be by the translocation of cytosolic bax protein to mitochondria.  apigenin was found to be more potent in inhibiting the her2/neu - overexpressing cells ( mda - mb-453 cells ) compared to basal level her2-neu- expressing cells (mcf-7 ) For instance, 40 m of apigen in resulted in 48% inhibitory effect in mda-mb-435 whereas in mcf- 7 it caused only 31% growth inhibition. It was also found to inhibit colony forming ability and nub-7 xenograft tumor growth in nonobese diabetic mouse model. Recent research by chiang et al . suggested the antiproliferative effect of apigenin in hepg2, hep3b and plc / prf/5 cells. It was found that the growth inhibitory effect of chrysin in c6 glioma cells was either though activating p38-mapk or mediating the inhibition of proteasome activity. Honey polyphenols showed to be a promising pharmacological agent for inhibiting cancer cell proliferation. galangin expressed antiproliferative effect on hl-60 cells on dose dependent manner and also induced dna fragmentation without loss of membrane integrity. acacetin , another important flavanoid inhibited the proliferation of a549 cells , induced apoptosis and blocked the cell cycle progression at g1 phase.',\n",
       " \"actinomycosis is an uncommon chronic granulomatous disease that presents as a slowly progressive , indolent , indurated infiltration with multiple abscesses , fistulas , and sinuses. actinomyCosis should be included in the differential diagnosis in cases with periodontal pain and inflammation that do not respond to nonsurgical treatment for periodontitis. more routine submissions of tissue removed from the oral cavity for biopsies may be beneficial for differential diagnosis. This article reports a case of actinomycosis - mimicking periodontitis - and provides a review of the literature related to the condition. A 46 -year - old female was referred to the department of periodontics of seoul st . mary 's hospital ( seoul , korea ) for treatment of chronic periodontism. She complained of throbbing pain on the right first and second molars of the mandible. A round, hard , floating , bluish - gray fragment in the interproximal area between the right first and second molar of the mandible was seen. The patient was prescribed to continue taking amoxicillin and clavulanate ( 625 mg three times a day for 4 weeks ) . the patient was monitored weekly for the first month and then monthly for four months. Actinomyces colonies can be identified using hematoxylin - eosin , gram , pas stains , and silver stain. The colonies have a basophilic center with eos inophilic rays terminating in pear - shaped clubs. The patient had a recurrence of throbbing pain. She is now scheduled for ongoing follow-up.  penicillin is the drug of choice for treating an infection caused by any of the actinomyces. surgical excision or debridement may be desired as well , especially if extensive necrotic tissue , fistulas , or a neoplasm is present. The patient did not present any recurrence of actinmycosis after a short course of amoxicillin - clavulanate because the infected tissue was totally excised.\",\n",
       " 'lean muscle mass declines with aging to 25% at 7580 years old. It is typically offset by gains in fat mass. There is a relatively greater decrease in peripheral fat mass compared with the central one. These age - related body composition changes are associated with negative health outcomes in elderly. We evaluated white male and female elderly subjects consecutively admitted to a physical medicine and rehabilitation division. Subjects not affected by acute illness, severe liver , heart , or kidney dysfunction, severe dementia were included in the study. Subjects with uncontrolled diabetes , dysthyroidism and other endocrinopathies , neoplasia were excluded. Bodyweight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg by using a precision scale. serum folate and vitamin b12 were determined using an immunoassay. High performance liquid chromatography was used to measure total plasma homocysteine levels. serum albumin was also analyzed using a nephelometric method. Participants underwent a detailed cognitive assessment that included the mini mental state examination. We evaluated white male and female elderly subjects consecutively admitted to a physical medicine and rehabilitation division. subjects not affected by acute illness, severe liver, heart, or kidney dysfunction, severe dementia, and had a bodyweight that had been stable for 6 months were included in the study. subjects with uncontrolled diabetes , dysthyroidism and other endocrinopathies , neoplasia , as well as patients treated with steroids , or with total walking incapacity were excluded. The study design was approved by the ethics committee of the university of pavia. Body composition measurement was assessed using dxa ( lunar prodigy dxa ; ge medical systems , waukesha , wi , usa ) The in vivo coefficients of variation were 4.20% and 0.48% for fat and muscle mass , respectively. The levels of serum folate and vitamin b12 were determined using an immunoassay. High performance liquid chromatography was used to measure total plasma homocysteine levels. ally correlated ( dxa variate and hematochemical variate ) built on a weighted sum of observed variables for each set. in the sem step , standardized root mean square residual ( srmr ) < 0.10 was considered for an adequate approximation. partial correlation of amp with rsmm was computed by maximum likelihood estimation , and evaluated by z - test (= estimate / standard error ) , considering p<0.05. ings are positive : albumin ( + 0.695 ) , triglycerides ( +.282 ) , homocysteine ( +0.193 ) , and folates ( 0.154 ) ; however , we referred to strong albumin and moderate triglycerides and homocy Steine canonical loadings to orientate the second canonical variate reading. c - reactive protein , vitamin b12 , hdl , and ldl had non - significant canonical / composite loadings ( r<0.10 ) and they were not included in the successive sem analysis. The partial correlation of amp with rsmm adjusting for demo - cognitive variables via sem , was equal to + 0,642 ( 95% confidence interval , + 0 The canonical loadings for the dxa set were ordered as follows: android fat, fat mass, gynoid fat, lean mass, and lean mass. The composite loadings ( ie. the correlation of each variable with the composite score) are also shown in table 2. The parameters assessed by dxa , albumin , and triglycerides were more influential on amp. c - reactive protein, vitamin b12 , hdl , and ldl had non - significant loadings. Amp is a synthetic variable of multidimensional adiposity and metabolic components. amp was correlated with muscle mass loss, assessed by rsmm. The study can shed light on the orientation and magnitude of adipo - metabolic markers. can be protective respect to muscle loss. This study suggests a good ( cross - sectional ) linear relationship between muscle mass loss with a composite profile of adiposity and metabolic related markers. considering that the age - related loss in skeletal muscle mass is associated with substantial social and economic costs, this work suggests that the assessment of body composition by dxa and routine metabolic biochemical markers could enter in the multidimensional geriatric approach.',\n",
       " 'heavy metal contamination in the environment is a major concern worldwide because of the toxicity of these metals and their potential threat to human health. Currently, quantification of heavy metals relies upon collection of liquid discrete samples for subsequent laboratory analysis. electrochemical detection has several advantages over these methods in their simplicity, fast response, and suitability for the preparation of inexpensive instrumentations. Hms - qu / cpe as a working electrode exhibits higher sensitivity and selectivity toward the detection of copper , lead and cadmium. A novel electrochemical method is developed for simultaneous determination of copper and lead in soil samples. Qu ( purity > 98.9% ) was obtained from shanghai reagent co. ( shan Shanghai , china)  of pb(ii ) ( 0.01  m ) was prepared by dissolving 0.5179  g lead powder ( tianjin reagent company , china ) in 4.0  m nitric acid 20  ml. an oxygen free nitrogen ( ofn ) gas ( 99.9995% , jinan gas company, china) was added to a stock standard solution. electrochemical analyzer ( chenhua instrumental co. , ch China) chi 842b controlled by a personal computer was used. Hms - qu / cpe was fabricated by dissolving 0.0240  g qu in 50  ml ethanol and mixed with 0.1  g hms paraffin oil and graphite powder. 0.5  g of powder was accurately weighed into the decomposing cell. 5.0  ml nitric acid , 5. 0  ml hydrochloric acid , and 5.3  ml peroxide were added to the sample solution. Figure 2 shows the electrochemical responses of 1.0  m ( each ) multicomponent cu(ii)/pb(ii) solution at qu / cpe, qu - il / cPE , and hms - qu /cpe. Redox peaks of qu were also observed at qu -il / c pe and hm - qu - cpe. The reduction peak currents of copper and lead are largely increased. Eis experiments were carried out using different modified electrodes at the frequency range from 60  khz to 0.1  hz at the perturbation amplitude of 5  mv. effective reaction sites of qu with metal ions on hms are remarkably increased due to the high surface area and strong adsorption ability of hms. hms - qu / cpe exhibits better capability of adsorptive preconcentration and higher sensitivity and selectivity. The concentration of copper , lead , and cadmium was determined by the standard addition method. The interference experiment of some cations and anions was also investigated. The stability and reproducibility of hms - qu / cpe were studied in 1.0  m ( each ) multicomponent cu(ii)/pb(ii) /cd(ii ) solution. The hms - qu / cpe exhibited dramatically high sensitivity and selectivity due to high surface area, numerous active sites, and strong adsorption ability of hms. After optimizing the parameters such as ph value , preconcentration time , and preconcentment potential , a novel electrochemical method is simple, fast , sensitive , and selective.',\n",
       " 'while inhaled corticosteroid ( ics)-containing regimens benefit certain patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) concerns about the inappropriate overuse of ics in real - life practice. This perspective paper explores the evidence available on ics withdrawal in patients with copd and the potential phenotypes that can be withdrawn from ics therapy. An algorithm for clinical practice is proposed to address the following critical questions. The introduction of ics in the management of copd was rather unorthodox and unsubstantiated for nearly 20 years. ics were adopted in copd on the basis of their effectiveness in asthma rather than scientific evidence. In 2001 a large population - based cohort study of 22,620 patients with copd and a very recent hospitalization found that those who received ics within 90 days postdischarge had 24% fewer rehospitalizations and a 29% risk reduction for mortality. The torch trial was the first to show that ics + laba was no more effective than a lama in preventing exacerbations in patients with severe copd. The findings of the summit trial were recently presented at the 2015 european respiratory society congress. A number of local and systemic adverse events have been associated with ics, particularly with long - term and high - dose use. A recent canadian population - based cohort study of 103,386 patients with copd who were treated with ics demonstrated that discontinuation of ics was associated with a 37% reduction in the risk of serious pneumonia. Long - term ics - containing treatment should not be prescribed outside their indication due to risk of pneumonia and the possibility of a slight increased risk of fractures following long - term exposure. According to the latest gold recommendations , patients with copd and a low risk of exacerbations should not be prescribed ics - containing regimens. It would be helpful to know if there are consequences associated with ics withdrawal in such populations ( ie , gold groups a and b) In the first real - life prospective study ( optimo [ real -life study on the appropriateness of treatment in moderate copd patients ] ) , it was demonstrated that withdrawal of ics in patients with symptomatic , moderateCopd was not associated with any deterioration in lung function , symptoms , and exacerbation rate. 2,485 patients with copd and a history of exacerbations received triple therapy ( ie , fluticasone propionate / tiotropium / salmeterol ) during a 6-week run - in period. in the ics withdrawal group , the dose of ics was gradually reduced by approximately half in a stepwise fashion every 6 weeks. after 12 weeks , ics is completely withdrawn. it was found that there was no difference in the occurrence of moderate or severe exacerbations between the two groups. ibrinogen , soluble interleukin adhesion molecule-1 , serum amyloid a , procalcitonin , and b - type natriuretic peptide were assessed. airway inflammation through differential cell count in sputum and fraction of exhaled nitric oxide ( feno ) was also assessed. No subgroups or biomarkers were found to be associated with an increased likelihood of exacerbations after ics withdrawal. Not all patients with moderate - to - severe copd are necessarily exacerbators , and therefore require ics. Dual bronchodilation ( ie , laba + lama) provided significantly better and clinically relevant improvements in lung function versus ics + laba. Up to 30% of patients with copd have eosinophilia. Blood eosinophil levels are currently a topical issue and defining the appropriate cutoff for determining ics responsiveness in patients with copd is a subject of intense discussion. In a recent post hoc analysis of two replicate , 12-month , double - blind rcts comparing a laba with ics + laba in a total of 3,177 patients with moderate - to - severe copd and a history of 1 exacerbation , it was found that across all doses of ics , ics plus laba significantly reduced exacerbations by 29% versus laba alone. Feno levels can be used as a surrogate marker of eosinophilic inflammation in patients with copd exacerbations. A recent review on acos suggested the following feno levels for comparing between patients with asthma , acos , and copd : > 50, 2550, and < 25 ppb. Feno between 25 and 50 ppb should be interpreted with caution. Stepwise ics withdrawal protocol on top of maintenance therapy with dual bronchodilation is primarily based on the wisdom trial. Instead of down - titrating ics every 6 weeks , it is proposed that physicians consider stepping down ics dose every 612 weeks. The rationale for this is to ensure that the effects of ics in the inflammation cascade of copd have been optimized. No clinical guidelines provide recommendations regarding the safe withdrawal of ics in patients with copd. Until this need is met, this perspective article proposes an algorithm for the stepwise withdrawal of\\xa0ics in real - life clinical practice based on the evidence available to date. therapy without doing harm.',\n",
       " 'type i scm is the one in which two hemicords are covered by a single dural tube separated by a non - bony fibrous septum. type ii scm differs in that two separate dural tubes hold exclusively the two Hemicords associated with an intervening bony spur. in the absence of associated cutaneous stigmata that prompts the clinicians to request screening imaging for the spinal cord, scm anomalies are usually diagnosed in relatively older children. 27-year - old male presented to our clinic complaining of chronic low back pain for a year and half after he sustained minor back trauma at work. magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) of his spine showed an arachnoid cyst posterior to t5 and t6 segments of the spinal cord causing anterior displacement of the cord and posterior cord flattening. starting at the level of t7-t8 , splitting of the spine was observed and continued down to t12 where the two hemicords then fused back to a normal conus medullaris. In normal human embryonic development, the continuous proliferation of cells during the first 2 weeks form a hollow spherical structure called blastocyst. During this process an ingression of the epiblast through the primitive groove toward the primitive streak occurs which forms at the caudal end of the embryo. After 2 - 8 days of formation of the primitive neuroenteric canal, it separates from the endoderm. chmal cleft between the notochord and the ectodermal layer splitting the neural tube. according to the unified theory proposed by pang in 1992 , the development of the intervening structure ( bony spur vs. fibrous septum ) depends on composite scms. A review of the english literature revealed only eight cases diagnosed with composite scm. The presence of multiple accessory neuroenteric fistulas ( endomesenchymal tract ) in this multi - segmental scm is exceedingly rare. Our patient presented in adulthood unlike the reported cases. He had mild right side plantar flexion weakness and decreased sensation over the right l4-l5 dermatome. Multi - level non - contagious scms are very rare entities with only eight reported cases in the literature. We have provided a systematic review of all the reported cases along with an anatomical and pathological description of the malformation. We proposed adding a new classification to further our understanding of the natural history of scms and the consequences of surgical interventions.',\n",

       " 'There are very few data sets of spatial and temporal patterns of macroalgal biomass and npp from which the consequences of long - term change can be assessed and compared. The bulk of information on seaweed biomass and production to date has come from short - term studies done over small spatial scales using a wide variety of methods. We use a unique 6 -year data set from southern california. Densities of plants and fronds are among the most commonly measured variables in population studies of m. pyrifera. We examined the utility of density data in estimating npp on a seasonal basis as well. Data were collected from january 2003 through december 2008 at three giant kelp forests. To estimate foliar standing crop ( hereafter fsc , which we define as the standing biomass minus the mass associated with holdfasts and reproductive blades termed sporophylls ) we characterized each plant as consisting of three distinct sections. For each plant within the permanent plots we counted the number of fronds 1  m above the holdfast ( n1 m ) and the number  fronds at the surface ( nsurface ) We measured the water depth at the top of the hold fast ( d ) and we measured the length of the canopy portion of the longest frond ( max ) We used these measurements to calculate the combined length of all fronds in each plant section according to the following equations. The lengths of the three plant sections were summed to obtain the total length of each plant . 1, 2, and 3 in estimating the total frond length. The length of adult m. pyrifera collected monthly from each of three sites during the period june 2002june 2003 ( n  =  55 plants ) . We measured the length of all fronds on each plant. Total length was converted into total mass using relationships generated from length and weight measurements of the 55 adult m. pyrifera collected from the field. The wet mass of each plant was converted to dry mass based on the average moisture content of blades collected haphazardly from 10 to 15 plants at each site during each monthly survey. where t is the number of days in the sampling interval. this exponential model implies that npp at any moment is the product of g and s. by assuming that growth and loss rates are constant over the period. we estimated daily npp for each sampling interval by integrating instantaneous npp over the interval and dividing by t. npp was expressed as daily rates to account for slight variations in the length of the sampling intervals. mean daily npp for each astronomical season ( i.e. winter, spring, summer, and autumn) was calculated as the mean npp averaged over all days in the season. annual npp in a given year was calculated by averaging the mean and average npp from all days of the year. The abundance of plants increased dramatically in late spring and summer reaching peak densities in september before steadily declining through december. Average plant size ( as indicated by the mean number of fronds per plant ) was greatest in winter and spring when plant densities were lowest. Not surprisingly, fsc was positively related to densities of both plants and fronds. The usefulness of plant density in estimating seasonal npp varied greatly with the time of year. plant density explained a relatively large amount of variability in npp in the winter and autumn ( i.e. , 7594% ) , and a much small amount variability during spring and summer. By comparison, the relationship between frond density and seasonal. npp was much more constant throughout the year with r values ranging between 0.6 and 0.9. The density of fronds provided a relatively good estimate of annual npp , particularly when measured in june, july , or august when it explained a remarkable 7081% of the variability in Annual npp. In contrast, the density of plants steadily deteriorated over the course of the year from a high r value of 0.65 in february to a low of  0.18 in October and November.  winter  =  2.18 ( march frond density )  mean daily npp during spring    1.08 ( april fronddensity )  +  2  meandaily npp. during summer  =\\xa0 1.22 ( august frond. density)  meanDailyNpp during autumn  =. 0.93 ( november frond densities) The relationships that we found among these variables are relatively robust and can be used to estimate fsc and npp of m. pyrifera from a wide range of population densities. The density of fronds consistently provided a better estimate of npp than the density of plants resulted from frond density being much more strongly correlated to fsc than plant density. M.pyrifera fronds in santa barbara and elsewhere in california generally consist of a cylindrical stipe to which corrugated leaf - like blades ( lamina ) are attached via gas bladders ( pneumatocyst ) at intervals ( nodes ) that progressively decrease in length from the holdfast upwards to the sea surface. The relationships between frond density and standing crop that we derived for m. pyrifer a are likely to apply generally to the attached corrugate blade form of the species in other regions. The timing of data collection within a season should be considered when devising a sampling plan for estimating seasonal npp. The timing of m. pyrifera growth , recruitment and mortality are known to vary with latitude ( kain 1989 ; brown et al). specific relationships between frond density and annual npp will need to be tailored to regional - specific patterns in these demographic processes. There is considerable interest and concern regarding the extent to which patterns of primary production are being altered by global and regional environmental change.',\n",

Two commercial bulk - fill composite systems were tested. Two conventional composite that required 2-mm increments was used as control.

       " 'ccm alloy has been used to construct artificial joints in orthopedics since the early 1990s. ccm alloy forms a thicker oxidized layer than other alloys when casted at high temperature. biological safety, mechanical stability , and performance compared with gold abutments have not been fully investigated. The prosthesis was polished using laboratory handpiece and rouge equipped with a cotton wheel. A standard mold was used consistent with the mold used in chewing simulator cs4. The stylus was positioned 3 mm away from the crown center. The removal torque value was recorded every 0.1 seconds using the quickdataacq software program. We measured the removal torque value to evaluate the interface between abutment and fixture on the prosthesis using gold and ccm ucla abutments. Independent t - tests were conducted based on the calculated mean and standard deviation. No remarkable wear patterns were observed at the interface of ccm and gold abuts. The screw can be fractured once it becomes loosened and is subject to continual loading. There are also greater fracture risks for loosened screws when additional loading is applied to the adjacent implant. The factors influencing preload produced by screw tightening include tension of friction, yield strength of screw material, elastic modulus , and fatigue. Both titanium and ebony gold screws had the same recommended torque of 30 ncm. The fixture - abutment interface of an external hex implant is less stable than that of an internal hex implant. The mean removal torque values measured after chewing simulation using thermocyclic functional loading were 20.31 and 20.38 ncm for the gold and ccm ucla abutments. The mean removal torque values and the recorded data distributions did not significantly differ between the gold and ccm ucla abutment groups. The stability of abutments - fixture interface is equivalent for the two groups based on similar mean torque values, standard deviations , and removal torque value distribution patterns. The ccm alloy may cause significant mechanical damage to the fixture when loaded for long periods. If tribocorrosion takes place at the interface of ccm alloy , it is harmful to the living body due to direct release of metal ion. The current study focused on only mechanical properties with potential applications for the field of prosthodontics. Further study is required to focus on biological properties of cca and gold ucla abutments.',\n",

The crimean congo hemorrhagic fever virus ( cchfv) strain ba66019 m segment open reading frame representing 1689 amino acids. The complete m rna genome of ba8402 is 5367 nt long , with a nucleotide composition of 30.8% adenine , 25.2% uracile , 21.8%, guanine and 22.2%. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on 4,722 nt of the medium ( m ) rna segment. The two chinese strains have an extra proline ( ccc for ba66019 and ccu for ba8402 ) at position 126 , which is missing from strain ibar10200. At least three subtypes of cchfv n protein are in circulation, with substantial genetic variability. The two chinese strains differed from each other by 10% and from the ibar10200 strain by 13%. The high degree of divergence of the first part of the genome between the three strains indicates either that its function does not depend on a specific primary sequence or that the functional variability of these elements has no major impact on the cchfv life cycle. The positions of all 79 cysteine residues in both g1 and g2 proteins are determined. We determined the complete m rna sequences of two cchfv strains isolated in china. conserved , suggesting that these two proteins are structurally similar.

       " 'in january 2007 , the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists ( acog ) practice bulletin number 77 recommended  screening and invasive diagnostic testing should be available to all women who present for prenatal care before 20 weeks of gestation. This includes first trimester nuchal translucency, pregnancy - associated plasma protein a ( papp - a ) and human chorionic gonadotropin ( hcg ) plus maternal serum quad screening in the mid - trimester. This is a retrospective cohort study of all patients who completed first trimester nt and biochemical screening at our institution between june 2007 and february 2010. This study was approved by the washington university human research protection office , which waived informed consent. All nt measurements were performed by physicians or sonographers certified in nt measurement by the fetal medicine foundation or the nuchal translucency quality review ( ntqr ) program. The study population consists of 2,643 patients who met inclusion criteria during the study period ( june 2007february 2010 ) during this time, an acceptable nt measurement was unable to be obtained in 8 patients. At the time of the first trimester examination, 1,926 ( 72.8  % ) were undecided regarding stepwise sequential screening.

A total of 91(3.4  % of the study population ) women had invasive testing by amniocentesis or cvs during the study period. In 59(64.8  % ) , the age - risk for t21 was greater than the screen - risk. The indications for invasive testing were varied and included ama , abnormal ultrasound findings , abnormal screening and family history of aneuploidy. Women of lower education level and black or hispanic ancestry were least likely to desire further screening or testing following their first trimester screen results. It is possible this represents lower health literacy in these groups with less of an appreciation or even misinterpretation of the consequences and benefits of stepwise sequential screening. Numeric risks should be stressed over verbal description of risks. An absolute number as expressed by the screen - risk provides the patient with an estimate not only of the risk for t21 , but also the chance the pregnancy is not at risk. A screen- risk of 1:1,000 or less, not an unusual result, predicts not only a 1: 1,000 chance of t21, but roughly a 999:1,.000 a fetus does not have t21. A negative test provides sufficient reassurance to obviate further testing or to allow diagnostic testing via amniocentesis rather than cvs. The majority of our population did not require or desire this information to make informed choices regarding their pregnancy. The influence of other factors , including religious , economic , and the perceived effects of a child with aneuploidy on the existing family structure also play an important role in the patient interpretation of and response to screening results. First trimester screening is the major reason for the decrease in invasive procedures. receiving a very low risk early in pregnancy gives many women the reassurance that their pregnancies are normal. It may be that this makes it easier for some to believe that further testing is unnecessary. While noninvasive prenatal testing with cell free fetal dna is presently limited, the anticipated expanded application of such technology will lead to a reduction in the need for invasive testing.  communication of risk for aneuploidy is especially important and challenging in the prenatal setting. 80  % of our study population ultimately declined follow- up testing after first trimester screening. Nearly one - half of those who initially planned to pursue stepwise sequential screening did not do so.',\n",
       " 'interest in the functional relationship between cadherin adhesion and rho family gtpases was first prompted by the observation that several members of this family localized to cell  cell contacts. No simple functional pattern has emerged because the consequences of gtpase signaling depend profoundly on cellular context. The most consistent results were obtained upon manipulation of either rac or rho signaling. Cadherin - containing cells adhered to substrata coated with ligands for either xenopus c - cadherin ( noren et al. 2001 ) or poly - l - lysine ( kovacs et al . , 2002a ) rapid stimulation of gtp.rac levels was observed. This was a specific consequence of cadher in ligation , and not due to changes in cell shape concomitant. Rho or cdc42 activity did not change as acute responses to cadherin ligation. homophilic ligation appears to have more diverse effects on gtpase signaling. sustained engagement of cadherins is likely to have complex consequences for gtpases that are influenced by cell type.  rac appears to be critical for this process of contact - zone extension. When studied in native cell  cell contacts, as well as when cells adhere to cadherin - coated substrata, rac is recruited to newly forming contacts. One likely link between rac signaling and contact zone extension is through regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Cadherin ligation in newly forming contacts activates rac signaling at the plasma membrane via a pi3 kinase dependent intermediary step. One key consequence of rac activation is the stimulation of cadherin - directed actin assembly by arp2/3. iqgap is a multidomain protein that can act as a downstream effector of both cdc42 and rac. overexpression of iq gap reduced cadher in - based cell adhesiveness. Rho family gtpases function as molecular switches. Their participation in cell signaling depends on both their intrinsic capacity to interact with downstream effector molecules and their correct subcellular localization. Several potential candidate gefs exist that might mediate the early activation of rac by classical cadherins. Cadherin ligation can recruit type 1a pi3 kinase to the cadherin complex and stimulate pi3Kinase activity. inhibition of pi3 Kinase activity prevented full stimulation of rac by e - cadher in signaling. classical cadherins may influence the precise sites at the plasma membrane where rho family signaling occurs. It is possible that the numerous protein  protein interactions reported between classical cadherins and other signaling molecules reflect alternate modes of cadherin signaling. It has been suggested that e - Cadherin may cocluster and activate egf receptor signaling in a manner independent of egf itself. heterotypic cis - interactions between cadher Ins and receptor tyrosine kinases may therefore constitute a separate paradigm of cadhers - activated signaling.',\n",

       " 'arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (aclr) is one of the most common procedures in knee surgery. Septic arthritis after aclr has received little attention in the orthopedic literature as it is relatively uncommon with incidence of 0.14 to 0.48%1,2. Between september 2006 and february 2008, a single surgeon performed 79 arthroscopic aclrs. The incidence of septic arthritis by s. epidermidis between september 2006 and february 2008 was 7.6% . all the six patients included in this study were men ranging in age from 20 to 53 years. Two of them received a four - strand hamstring autograft , three , a tibialis allograft, and one , an achilles allogsraft. The local and systemic symptoms and signs in the development of septic arthritis were nonspecific with various clinical presentations. In some patients the crp remained elevated continuously, while in others it decreased to a relatively low level following the initial procedure and then increased rapidly. In all patients, s. epidermidis was identified in the final joint aspirate , as reported after the secondary operation. The incidence of septic arthritis following arthroscopic procedures is between 0.01 and 0.23% , and the reported incidence after aclr is 0.14% to 0.48%1,2 ) . staphylococcus aureus is the most common infecting organism and s. epidermidis is another frequent cause. We could not find any source of contamination despite intensive surveillance of the surgical equipment and surgical team. The classic clinical evidence of septic arthritis is swelling, rapidly progressive knee pain, restricted motion, local erythema, local warmth , and fever. The average interval between the onset of symptoms and the original procedure was 4.7 days. Local heat, joint effusion with swelling , and limitation of motion were observed in all patients. Crp is a more accurate predictor of postoperative complications than esr if the blood level remains elevated or rises unexpectedly. Usually the leukocyte count in septic joint fluid exceeds 50,000 with predominance of neutrophils. In our cases , the wbc count was at least 22,400 and the differential was 80 - 90% polymorphonuclear cells. Indelli et al. reported six cases of septic arthritis with s. aureus infection in three, s. epidermidis in two and non - hemolytic streptococcus in one. The infection was diagnosed within 24 hours of symptom onset and the grafts were preserved. Four patients required an average of 2.75 procedures to eradicate the infection. Arthroscopic lavage using normal saline and debridement for acute septic arthritis of the knee is a well - described and effective therapeutic intervention. We also treated s. epidermidis infection successfully with arthroscopy lavage and de Bridement. Only one additional operation was needed in our six patients.',\n",
       " 'Many fundamental properties of finite point sets do not depend on the actual coordinates of each point in real space, but rather on the relative position of the points among each other. In their landmark paper, goodman and pollack capture this idea by defining the order type of a point set. In the plane, two point sets have the same order type if there is a bijection between the sets s.t. p(t , q , r)p( t , r , p) p(p , q, r) p (p , s , t ) p(t, p , q)p (p, q, s) p  p( p , r, t) p p (t, r, p ) p (q, s, p) In section 3 we describe an algorithm to compute a halving edge through a given point c of a finite point set s of size n in the plane. We first show that the algorithm runs in o(n ) time for realizable sets. We then show the time bound is also correct for non-realizable sets, that is, for all cc systems. The median m = pn2 with respect to  can be computed in o(n ) time. The algorithm has linear running time as we exclude approximately half of the points in each linear - time iteration. We argue that the above approach does not require that s is realizable , that is , it works for any cc. The order  around c we use is also defined for cc systems by signing the points in a way that the positive points are to the right of 1. This allows us to give a purely combinatorial formulation of our algorithm. The algorithm is also adaptable to more sophisticated problems than finding a halving edge. One example is the search for a balanced line. In this section we show how to compute a convex hull edge of a set in linear time, only using the orientation of triples. We first present the algorithm for point sets and then extend it to general cc systems. As a first step we describe an algorithm called basicmin, which plays a crucial role as a subroutine. For each of the n22 edges in m at least one endpoint lies to the right of . If there is an edge in m for which both points lie to the left of . then also the crossing with the x - axis is to theleft of the crossing of m. The main observation is that in the search for u1 , given a point ui and the tangent t passing through ui , we can discard all points of u to the right of ui with respect to the point l where t touches ch(l{p , q } ) This is because the radial order of l around any ui is linear. However, consecutive  bad choices of  ui result in overall quadratic worst case behavior. Given two points  p and q, one can find the edge e of the sets convex hull that passes through the ray pq in  o(n) time using the predicate . w.l.o.g . In linear time, this problem can be reduced to constant size such that it then can be solved by a brute - force approach. Let m be an arbitrary perfect matching between the points of u to the left and to the right of pur ( maybe omitting one point) Now we apply basicmin on m with r = ur , which results in an edge m = uaub. by construction, all edges of m as well as uaUB cross the ray pur. due to lemma 4, at least half of the points  are to theright of . otherwise, if  does not cross the rays, then all points  to theRight of are also to right of . in both cases, we can discard at least a quarter of  the points, which is at least  larger than l. In section.4 in this subsection , we will give a brief summary of the relevant properties of abstract order types following goodman and pollack. throughout this section , let us again start in the euclidean plane by considering a point set s. for every subset of s , the circular sequence therefore gives the point on its convex hull. Pseudo - line arrangements can be extended by additional pseudo - lines. The lemma 6levi enlargement lemmagiven a pseudo - line arrangement can be used to get x - monotonicity. This requires the application of the levi enlargements lemma to getx - monotone. For every point set in the euclidean plane, the standard duality transform for point sets gives an arrangement of straight lines whose crossings give a half - period of the circular sequence of the set. There are arrangements of pseudo - lines in the projective plane that are not stretchable. We can use either the axioms or a pseudo - line arrangement ( together with a direction around a point at infinity ) for arguing about abstract order types. In section 2.5 we use the dual representation of abstract order types in the euclidean plane by x - monotone pseudo - lines. In general the order type does not capture the relative position of the supporting lines of point pairs and the crossings of these lines. However, abstract order type capture some of the information that is related to crossings of supporting lines. In the dual x - monotone pseudo - line arrangement a representing the abstract order type of s. we want to obtain the pair l1u1,l1l , u1u that is consecutive on the convex hull of s, where p is to the right of l1a1. In the dual , the right pseudo - lines pass above the crossing pr , and the left pseudo - Lines pass below. The crucial property for m in the dual therefore is to have at least one pseudo - line of each pair sim passing below its crossing in a. for realizable point sets we were able to argue for the correctness of basicmin using the intersection of a matched pair s with the supporting line of p and r. In non - realizable settings the intersections behave in the same transitive manner as in the realizable setting. At least one point of each pair ( v , w ) in m is to the right of the directed line, as demanded in the proof of theorem 5. Theorem 5 also holds for non - realizable cc systems, i.e. abstract order types. As a first step we describe an algorithm called basicmin , which plays a crucial role as a subroutine.  basicmin takes a point set s and two points p and r as input. It partitions s arbitrarily into the matching m={s1, ,s(n22 ) } , and computes a special edge m = m( n22 ) iteratively. For each of the n22 edges in m at least one endpoint lies to the right of . For each of the n22 edges in m at least one endpoint lies to the right of .   note that , even though the argumentation of lemma 4 involves relative positions of crossings , the constant - time operation can be expressed by using only . now we are ready to give the main algorithm . The radial order of l{p , q } around any ui is linear. we discard the points of u right of lui and iterate. consecutive  bad  choices of ui result in overall quadratic worst - case behavior. we therefore have to make a  good  choice of  ui in order to discard a linear number of points per iteration. Let pq be horizontal with q left of p. Let u be the set strictly above pq , whereas l is set strictly below pq. Consider the endpoint u1u of e. If we remove u1, the ray pq intersects the boundary of the ( new ) convex hull at a new edge e with an endpoint u2u. There are several equivalent definitions for the convex hull of a finite point set s in the plane. In order to show that the bound also holds for abstract order types , we need to prove that basicmin also works as expected on non - realizable sets. In this subsection, we will give a brief summary of the relevant properties of abstract order type following goodman and pollack. The circular sequence allows us to observe several geometric properties of s. a point that precedes all others in some permutation ( on  ) in the circular sequence is an extreme point. we therefore can identify the vertices of the convex hull as those points that are topmost or bottommost on  at some point. Pseudo - line arrangements in the projective plane p2 can be extended by additional pseudo - lines. This requires the application of the levi enlargement lemma to get x - monotonicity. For every point set in the euclidean plane, the standard duality transform for point sets gives an arrangement of straight lines. Pseudo - lines in the projective plane are not stretchable. No point set in the euclidean plane exists that implies any sequence derived from such an arrangements. Given a direction around a point at infinity allows us to give a triple of pseudo - lines an orientation, even if there does not exist a corresponding point set order type. In section.5 we use the dual representation of abstract order types in the euclidean plane by x - monotone pseudo - lines. This allows us to use the obvious meaning of terms like  above  and  below. We are given a set s of n elements ( which we call points ) , containing two special points p and q. The set s is separated by pq into a set u to the right of pq and a set l to the left of it ( where  left  and right  are indicated by a predicate a ) In the dual x - monotone pseudo - line arrangement a representing the abstract order type of s. of u ( minus a constant ) are to the right of  and no point of l is to the left of . consider the pair m = uaub ( and later the line  tangent to ch(l{p , q } ) through ua or ub ) . The crucial property of m is that at least one endpoint of each pair sim lies on the same side of m as the pivot p. For non - realizable sets such a pseudo - line exists due to the levi enlargement lemma. In non-realizable settings the intersections behave in the same transitive manner as in the realizable setting. See fig . 7 for an illustration of the following statement. At least half of the points are on the same side of m as p. reach the crossing ab . both cases contradict the fact that a pair of pseudo - lines intersects exactly once in the x - monotone arrangement. thus , we conclude theorem 8theorem 5 also holds for non - realizable cc systems, i.e. abstract order types. Chans output - sensitive algorithm can be implemented in our setting using theorem 5. convex hull edge on the ray that separates a subproblem into two parts. both allow to improve the time bound given in   for realizable point sets regarding output - sensitivity to o(nlogh ) for h extreme points.',\n",

       " \"we identified 134 consecutive patients with clinically diagnosed msa whose brains were sent to the mayo clinic brain bank between 1998 and 2014 from 37 states and 1 province of canada. brain autopsies were obtained after consent of the legal next of kin and are considered exempt from human subject research. most patients were white ; 7 were asian , 1 was pacific islander , and 1 was african american. A neurologist abstracted the following information from medical records collected throughout the course of disease and entered it into a database: sex, age at symptomatic onset , age at death, family history of neurologic disease, initial and final clinical diagnoses, signs and symptoms during the disease course and their timing. for each patient, a particular clinical symptom or sign if clinical symptoms or signs were not described , then for the purpose of analysis , they were considered to be absent. All patients were retrospectively assigned a diagnosis of probable or possible msa from available clinical information according to the second consensus criteria of msa. We identified 134 consecutive patients with clinically diagnosed msa whose brains were sent to the mayo clinic brain bank between 1998 and 2014 from 37 states and 1 province of canada. All cases underwent a standardized neuropathologic assessment for alzheimer - type and lewy - related pathologies as previously reported. braak neurofibrillary tangle ( nft ) stage and thal amyloid phase were assigned to each case based upon thioflavin s fluorescent microscopy. immunohistochemistry for -synuclein ( nacp ; 1:3,000 ) was used to establish neuropathology diagnosis of msa. Sleep behavior disorder ( rbd) was considered to be positive if there was documented blood pressure drop of at least 30/15 mm hg ( according to msa criteria ) or patients were medicated for orthostatic hypotension ( e.g. fludrocortisone , midodrine ) cognitive impairment was considered positive if at least short - term memory loss , disorientation , or executive dysfunction were diagnosed by a physician. The degree of levodopa responsiveness was recorded as no response , partial response , or good response. 83 of 134 patients with a clinical diagnosis of msa were received by the brain bank in the time frame of the study. Diagnostic accuracy was not different between general neurologists ( 33/53 ) and movement disorder specialists ( 35/56 ) correctly diagnosed patients with msa had a younger age at onset and age at death than patients with pd or psp. The breakdown of lewy - related pathology and pathologic variants of msa is summarized in table 1. urinary incontinence , limb ataxia , nystagmus , and pyramidal signs were more frequent in msa than in dlb. cognitive impairment and visual hallucinations were more often in pd than ind.

       " 'The time consumed in mpg using punches of less than 1.5 mm is more when compared with punch grafting with 2 - 3 mm punches. More over the number of grafts required is also more with decrease in punch sizes. We performed mpg in 10 patients of stable vitiligo on various sites with motorised power punch to see its efficacy and feasibility. The grafts were harvested from the donor site and placed in the recipient chambers. tissue glue was used to fix the grafts and dressed in two layers with 1 cm framycetin tulle pieces followed by sterile gauze and dynaplast. The patients were assessed every 15 days for 3 months and once a month for the next 3 months. All 15 sites showed good cosmetic colour match especially on lips , face and neck. Cobble stoning is the most common and can be prevented by using punches of less than 1.5 mm and about 1 - 1.2 mm on face and neck. 13 out of 15 sites ( 86.7% ) repigmented with excellent cosmetic colour match.

       " \"The promise of gene therapy has yet to be realized for lack of a safe, efficacious, and specific delivery vector. viral vectors are naturally equipped to evoke maximal gene expression but have failed to prove safety in clinical trials. In contrast, cationic polymers and lipids demonstrate superior safety but do not afford clinically relevant levels of gene expression. polyethylenimine is considered a leading polycationic vector for gene delivery. Plasmid encoding the firefly luciferase gene was purchased from aldevron ( fargo , nd) Plasmid was purified by sequential desalting. fully deacylated linear pei of 22-kda was synthesized from commercial 200-Kda poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline ) , peoz. lation through comparison of the integration of the 0.51  ppm triplet from the protons of the terminal methyl group of the alkane with the 2.53  ppm peak of the polymer 's ethylene protons. acid titrations were carried out using a 1-ml solution of each n - alkyl - pei ( 113  mm in ch2ch2nh units ) adjusted to ph 11.5 with naoh. sequential additions of 20-l volumes of 0.5  m hcl were performed and the ph after each addition was measured. Mice were anesthetized with a lethal dose of avertin, the vena cava was cut, a blood sample was collected, and the animals were perfused with pbs using a peristaltic pump at a flow rate of about 20  ml / min for 510  min. Once the perfusion ran clear , the organs were dissected and assayed for gamma counts using 5-minutes read time. We prepared a series of n - alkylated linear pei derivatives with the goal of developing a more efficient and specific vector for in vivo transfection. The ability to buffer endosomes / lysosomes and condense dna is a necessary requirement for efficient gene delivery by polycationic vectors. To assess the effect of n - alkylation on the ability of pei to mediate these steps , the peis were characterized by acid titration and ethidium bromide ( etbr ) displacement from plasmid dna. All mouse tissues examined each demonstrate a unique expression profile with respect to the alkyl chain length. In the heart and liver, propyl - pei performs the best by 3.5- and 581-fold over the parent polycation. in the kidneys, octyl- pei provides 221-fold greater expression than unmodified pei. maximal expression of luciferase is seen in the spleen. We treated mice with i - labeled dna in complexes with the n - alkylated linear pei derivatives to follow the localization of the delivered plasmid. The biodistribution of the polyplexes was determined in vivo at 24  h , the time point of the efficiency study. Less than 0.01% of the injected dose remained in the lung at 24 h regardless of the delivery vector. delivery of plasmid via a polycationic vector does not change the biodistribution of the plasid at either 15  min or 24  h. This suggests that at least in the case of linear pei , its n - alkylation does not enhance uptake of the polyplexes and instead plays some other , yet to be determined role. While n - ethylation greatly improves the efficacy of gene expression in the mouse lung relative to that by the parent polycation, n - propyl - pei and n - octyl- pei are dramatically better performers than pei in the liver and kidneys.\",\n",
       " 'in this article , we explore the potential of the right to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress and its applications. We use the example of multidrug - resistant tuberculosis ( mdr - tb ) to highlight relevant questions for further discussion. better understanding of the rebsp may well facilitate greater likelihood that patients and communities will realize their rights to health. The right to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress as a human right has remained rather obscure and unexplored in human rights discourse. In the period of the drafting of the udhr and the icescr between 1946 and 1966 , there was much optimism about the potential contribution of science to improving human life and living conditions. Science as a concept relates to obtaining and expanding knowledge and understanding processes and phenomena which occur in nature and society. The link with the realization of human rights can be found in the terms  progress and  benefits in articles 27 and 15. Both terms therefore link to the notion of progressive realization of economic, social , and cultural rights as laid out in article 2.1. Scientific progress will not benefit one person only , or a limited group of people . . this will particularly apply when progress in pharmaceutical research leads to greater availability and accessibility of drugs for the treatment of mdr - tb. A human rights approach which focuses on strengthening access for the most vulnerable and marginalized groups may contribute to achieving equity. There have been no cases before courts where the rebsp has been directly invoked aimed at forcing a government to make an available medicine accessible for the treatment of a particular disease. This is due to its unknown nature , but also to the fact that it has not been recognized as a justiciable right that individuals can invoke directly. The number of international cases may increase in the future when the optional protocol to the icescr becomes more well - known.  eastern europe has the world s highest proportion of mdr - tb among all tb cases. of whom more than a third are not diagnosed and therefore not treated. Despite recent improvements , investment in tb drug research falls far short of what is estimated to be required.  bedaquiline and delamanid are both new classes of drugs with tb activity. Despite regulatory approvals in a range of countries for both new drugs, access to these drugs for mdr - tb patients has remained extremely limited. The reasons behind poor accessibility of these new drugs are multiple : high cost, potential side - effects leading to excess mortality, lack of systems for pharmacovigilance and resistance development. More efficacious mdr - tb treatment regimens will require a combination of new , repurposed , and existing drugs in order to maximize efficacy. funding and capacity to conduct trials that are not directly linked to drug registration is limited. as a result, ideally a continuous pipeline of new drug development should feed a constantly evolving clinical trial environment. Invest in human resource capacity to do research expedited regulatory approval for trials expedited approval for appropriate indication. engage with ( donor ) states , ngos , and international organizations to promote and organize r&d on new medicines subsidies or tax advantages to encourage private sector. ensure rights to a drug are available ( give away rights ) if pharma has no interest in manufacture. In the 1960s , when the icescr was adopted, governments were centrally involved in funding research and the direct development of science. This has changed drastically in present times, where the role and influence of the private sector ( corporations and private research institutes ) and non - state consortia has increased enormously. At the same time , the availability of public resources for research into new medicines has diminished. The obligation to promote has a long - term nature : it aims at providing information and convincing key players of the need to make essential medicines available. It may be combined with public awareness - raising campaigns aimed at empowering the general public to make informed choices about their health. Once evidence of effectiveness is obtained, states should ensure that the regulatory approvals are expedited and systems for distribution put in place. A complex set of operational questions requires guidelines for how best to implement new regimens for mdr - tb. These regimens must maximize access to new drugs of better efficacy and lower toxicity. They must also avoid development of further resistance through indiscriminate and poorly coordinated use of these medications. Lack of essential medicines for the treatment of neglected diseases is a global problem that demands a global response. It has been argued that especially governments in the global north who have the capacity and resources have an obligation to contribute to the fulfillment of human rights outside of their national boundaries. This is the idea of extraterritorial human rights obligations. There is a need to mobilize and share common but differentiated responsibilities of all relevant stakeholders, both governmental and non - governmental. A division and coordination of domestic and extraterritorial human rights obligations between states is required. A body of work developing that outlines the responsibilities of corporations for meeting human rights standards. These principles recognize the role of business enterprises as specialized organs of society. Universities are increasingly being called on to demonstrate their social responsiveness. Academic freedom is balanced against the expectation that universities focus their research in ways that prioritize the most urgent societal challenges. In practice, generous funding streams and academic reward systems responding to priority areas such as mdr - tb could and do influence researcher behavior and direct researcher focus. The who was previously seen as the undisputed steward of matters affecting health on a global scale has changed radically in the past 20 years. Questions have been raised about the accountability of these foundations and to what extent they have turned global health governance into a terrain dominated by rich and powerful interests. Civil society organizations and patient groups should persuade corporations to take up their social responsibility in this area. Non-state actors can be brought within the ambit of contributing to addressing one of the major public heath crises of the current period without holding the same level of accountability as states. We believe that there are enough grounds to warrant testing the rebsp framework further in different case settings both in relation to neglected diseases and other access - to - health contexts.',\n",

The diameters of the droplets were made larger by using a slower ( approximately 10% to 20% slower ) speed of agitation. The characteristics of the microcatheters and the contrast media used in this study are given in tables 1 and 2 . the following syringes were used : 1-ml bd leur - lok disposable syringe with a clear polycarbonate barrel ( becton , dickinson and company , franklin lakes , nj , usa ) , terumo 2.5-ml luer slip tip syringe ( terumo co. , ltd . , tokyo , The upper pressure limits of each syringe were calculated by averaging the maximum manual compression pressure ( mc ) applied by five healthy men ( triplicate measurements ) without using gsms or a microcatheter. The syringe , which was loaded with saline , was connected via a three - way stopcock to the digital pressure gauge equipped with a data processor. when the maximum pressure was below the upper pressure limit , the conditions were judged to be the gsm trials. The gsms were prepared using air - formed gelatin droplets in caprylic triglyceride. They were heat - treated in a vacuum drying oven at 155 c for four hours to cross - link the gelatin. The cross - linked particles were then dispersed in water to remove the soluble component. The resulting particles were dispensed into vials , lyophilized ( aseptic manipulation ) , and stored at room temperature or 5 c until use. The characteristics of the microcatheters and the contrast media used in this study are given in tables 1 and 2. Each vial contained 80 mg ( approximately 7 ml ) of gsms suspended in 10 ml of a contrast medium ( all medium types were used in the trials ) , which was gently shaken for one minute. The bubbles were removed by charging and discharging the syringe 10 times. The loaded syringes were connected to the catheters via a three - way stopcock equipped with a digital pressure gauge and a data processor. The gsm trials for each syringe volume started with the largest inner diameter catheter and lowest - viscosity contrast media. When the average or maximum pressure exceeded the upper pressure limit or the flow stopped due to clogging , the conditions were judged to be  noninjectable. The gsms were spherical , water - insoluble particles with interconnected pores. ger surface area ) of the syringes. When a 1-ml syringe was used , the injectability of gsms through catheters with inner diameters larger than 0.48 mm were confirmed to be feasible. The compression ratio was calculated to be less than 4% of the initial as determined by cross - sectional area. A larger caliber chatheter ( 2.7 to 5.0 fr catheter [ i d : 0.65 to 1.2 mm or more ] ) is still recommended for use of this product. Increases in the viscosity of the contrast media caused increases in the maximum pressure required during passage or clogging in the catheter. The ideal pressure loss calculated by fastracker-18mx is considered to be less than that by excelsior1018 or excel-14.  lower fluid viscosity (  ) can result in easier injection. Manufacturer s suggested operating pressure limit for each microcatheter is less than most of the pressures tested. Smaller gsms were confirmed to be injectable through microcatheters with an i d as small as 0.28 mm ( 0.011 inch) using a 1-ml syringe. Spherical particles with interconnected pores were prepared in the 2-mm size range. They are injectable through conventional - sized microcatheters ( i d : 0.53 mm ) using a 1.0- or 2.5-ml syringe with reasonable finger pressure. Tests for impurities ( caprylic triglyceride, isopropanol, endotoxins, bacteria , and fungus ) indicated that these gsms have the general properties necessary for use as medical devices.',\n",
       " 'neurotrophins were the first extracellular signals identified as regulators of somatosensory neuron development. The discovery of programmed cell death pathways provided an opportunity to separate the survival effects of nts from their other functions. In mice with a null mutation in bax naturally occurring neuronal death was eliminated in peripheral ganglia but gross development of the nervous system appeared normal. Central and peripheral axons can be specified by differential activation of receptors on these neurites. peripheral sensory axons often travel toward the periphery alongside motor axons before branching from the nerve trunks and approaching the skin. In vitro assays and embryological experiments suggest that cues in the developing skin attract them. Nt-3 and bdnf may act as short - range signals instead of directional cues to instruct initial axon migration into the maxillary process. Recent studies of zebrafish rb neurons identified another signaling system that regulates sensory axon guidance to the skin. Since the expression of lar receptors in somatosensory neurons is conserved it is possible that they are also involved in innervation of the embryonic skin in other vertebrate animals. ated by axons that grow in stereotyped patterns , like the three branches of the trigeminal , and regions of skin that are innervated by different classes of neurons , such as hairy and glabrous skin in mice. There is a striking difference in the density of sensory fiber innervation between the hand and digit tips of humans , a pattern that correlates with differential sensitivity to mechanical and painful stimuli. ngf was one of the first extrinsic factors found to stimulate branching of sensory axons. ervation in the distal hindlimbs of ngf / bax and trka / bx double knockout mice. A majority of sensory axons were able to coarse into the limb buds of embryonic mice, but failed to innervate and branch normally within the target territory. slit proteins appear to also positively regulate somatosensory axon branching.  bdnf was recently shown to influence sensory innervation of mouse mammary glands by regulating axon survival. androgen receptor signaling triggers this sensory pruning. knocking out expression of trkb significantly increased sensory fiber density in male embryonic mammary gland. molecular signals can also selectively stimulate particular subtypes of somatosensory axons to innervate appropriate targets. Knocking out gfr2 dramatically reduced the density of nonpeptidergic free nerve endings innervating the footpad. This effect was not due to decreased survival or axon outgrowth. The number of neurons in mutant drgs, as well as unmyelinated axons in the saphenous nerve, did not change. These results indicate that nrtn signaling through the gfr1 receptor complex is important for stimulating terminal innervation by nonpeptic nociceptive neurons.  partitioning the skin into discrete sensory receptive fields is critical for animals to accurately detect and localize stimuli along the surface of the body. repulsive cues pattern sensory territories by excluding innervation from certain regions of the skin. during embryonic stages interactions between growing neurites appear to play a role in arranging the territories of free endings with respect to one another. Studies of peripheral sensory axon guidance during the past 20 years have collectively identified the key navigational challenges encountered by many peripheral somatosensory axons. One of the major challenges for the future will be to identify the cues that make the axon morphologies of each kind of somatoensory neuron subtype different from one another.

In eight years, 503 cases were registered in the western region of santa catarina. The number of cm cases per year in the region ranged from 50 in 2002 up to 89 in 2008. The county with the highest prevalence of cm was so joo do oeste. The disease is more prevalent among women ( 292 cases ) than among men ( 205 cases) Most common histological type was superficial spreading cm ( ssm ) with 287 cases ( 59.92% ) , followed by nodular cm ( nm ) with 90 cases ( 18.79% ) and lentigo maligna cm ( lmm ) with 33 ( 8.89% ) Men showed a predominance of cm occurring on the head, neck , and trunk areas ( 58.9% ), and women on the limbs (59.8% ) When considering the sex of the patients, differences were observed in relation to the variability in pathological staging. In 2004 the bmg established the registro brasileiro de melanoma ( brazilian melanoma registry ) which enables complete clinical assessment of patients and subsequent dissemination of national data. The city of chapec is the official registration center of cm cases in the western region of santa catarina for the treatment of this malignancy. Western santa catarina has a higher risk of cm since it is an area colonized primarily by caucasians. The incidence of uv radiation increases by 7% during the summer in the southern hemisphere. The southern region presents a smaller thickness of the ozone layer along with a lower amount of dust. Gender is also considered a prognostic factor for cutaneous melanoma.

The major goal of type 2 diabetes management is to better regulate the blood sugar and prevent or slow the development of complications , such as retinopathy , nephropathy , neuropathy and cvd. Some researchers have recommended low - glycemic index ( gi ) diets as a strategy for improving diabetes. This study aimed to measure and compare the gi and pii of six kinds of fruit in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes in taiwan. 20 healthy non - diabetic people with a mean age of 21.9 years were enrolled in this study. The exclusion criteria were as follows : hba1c level higher than 7.5% ; complications , such as nephropathy ; and insulin - dependence. Twenty healthy non - diabetic people with a mean age of 21.9 years and 17 patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled in this study. The study was approved by the institutional review board of taipei medical university hospital and written informed consent was obtained from every subject. The characteristics of all subjects are listed in table 1 and 2. 17 type 2 diabetes patients were asked to fill out a questionnaire about their attitudes toward various fruits. The gi values of the six fruits were tested according to the standard gi testing protocol. One edible portion of fruit that contained 25  g carbohydrates was calculated using the amount of carbohydrates listed for each. The fasting blood glucose level in healthy non - diabetic people is 87.8    5.0 mg / dl , significantly lower than that in patients with type 2 diabetes. There are no significantly differences of height, weight , bmi and body fat between two groups. The fruits that type 2 Diabetes patients can not eat are lychees, longan , custard apples , bananas and mangos. Fruit is a very popular part of the taiwanese diet. carbohydrates are major components of fruits, especially monosaccharides ( glucose , fructose ) and dietary fiber. foods with low gi produce lower postprandial blood sugar levels and a lower overall blood sugar response than do foods with a high gi.  abnormal postprandial blood sugar levels are an early symptom of the development of type 2 diabetes. Similar to gi values , pii has also been used to evaluate postpr and glycemic effects of different foods. We recommend that to reduce bias , gi and pii should be considered together. Study measured the gi and pii of glucose , sucrose and honey in 12 healthy subjects and eight patients with insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus. They likewise found no remarkable difference between the healthy and diabetic patients in gi or pii. So we think that the Gi and Pii of foods in the healthy subjects could be applied to the diabetes patients.',\n",

       " ' classical and lectin pathways of complement ensure immediate recognition of invading bacteria as nonself. s. aureus expresses two surface - anchored proteins that impair igg function. Proteases prota and sbi bind the fc tail of igg preventing its interaction with fcr on neutrophils.  s. aureus expresses the surface proteins prota and sbi. Both proteins bind the fc tail of igg preventing its interaction with fcr on neutrophils. Another mechanism to prevent recognition is by inactivating igg , either directly by proteases ides , mac-2 , and speb , or indirectly by sak - activated plasmin.  direct inactivation of c3 convertases is the major complement target among s. aureus immune evasion strategies. The small 10-kd scin protein fixates the convertase conformation and as such hampers a critical rearrangement of the protease subunit bb in relation to substrate c3. The action of scin on the classical pathway convertase remains to be resolved. M protein consists of two polypeptide chains configured in an alpha - helical coiled coil complex that is anchored to the cell membrane via its c terminus. The protein comprises four repeat regions : hypervariable ( a ) , variable ( b ) , and conserved ( c and d ) depending on the m type , the hypervariable region can bind fh , fhl-1 , and c4bp. By binding these complement regulators, m protein limits deposition of c4b and c3b increasing gas resistance to phagocytosis. The structure of chips in complex with the n terminus of the c5ar showed two sulfated tyrosine ( residues 11 and 14 ) of thec5ar to be essential for the interaction in between the c 5ar and the inhibitor chips. neutrophil influx and phagocytosis are inhibited by chips , which binds the c4ar , and scpa that cleaves c5a. bacterial complement modulators have important applications for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Bacteria could be used as an indicator of the  achilles heel  of the human immune system almost at the atomic level. We believe that targeting of complement evasion molecules should be included in future strategies to fight bacterial infections. We propose to inhibit the inhibitor and thereby decrease the advantage of the bacterium over the host.',\n",

A total of 81 consecutive adult patients with physician diagnosed asthma were recruited from the asthma clinic of obafemi awolowo university teaching hospital ile - ife osun state nigeria. Patients with other comorbidity conditions like copd and hypertensive heart disease and those with pre - existing recognized psychopathology were excluded. ethical clearance for the study was obtained from the institutions ethical committee. Each patient completed the mini - asthma quality of life questionnaire ( 11) and hospital anxiety and depression scale ( 12) The lung function was assessed by peak expiratory flow meter ( micro medical ltd , rochester , uk ) after due explanation of the procedure and accompanied demonstration. The instrument has been widely used and standardized among nigerians where a minimum score of eight ( 8) on each of the subscales has been observed to indicate the presence of significant symptoms. All data were analyzed using the statistical package for the social sciences ( version 11 ) , chicago , il . descriptive statistics were used and the test of association was done using chi squared test for proportions and student pearson 's correlation.  asthma is a disease that can result in varying degrees of restrictions affecting the physical, emotional , and social spheres of a patient 's life. This study suggests that the comorbidity of asthma and psychological symptoms affect the quality of life of asthmatics. There was also an inverse relationship between the peak expiratory flow ( pef ) rate and overall asthma quality ofLife ( aqol )  limitation to this study included the fact that assessment was done only once thus change in patients diseased state and quality of life could not be assessed. The instrument used was also not compared to another instrument thus its effectiveness can not be fully assessed. This study has shown that psychological and sociodemographic factors apart from disease specific variables are important determinants of quality ofLife among asthmatics.\",\n",

Such as rhodanine and 2,4-thiazolidinedione derivatives have broad spectrum of pharmacological activities. Some of them are clinically used such as ciglitazone for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and related complications. The only rhodanine acetic acid derivative that has been used clinically is the aldose reductase inhibitor epalrestat 4. It was marketed in japan and used to slow eye damage associated with diabetes and to prevent diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Many other enzymes are also inhibited by the derivatives of this structural class and may be responsible for their various biological effects. Moorthy and his group designed and synthesized 5-isopropylidiene derivatives of 5-benzilidene-3-ethyl rhodanine. They found all the compounds induced cytotoxicity in a time- and concentration - dependent manner on leukemic cell line, cem. Among these compounds, btr-1 9 was found to be manifold more potent in inducing cytot toxicity. The aryl rhodanines 1619 specifically inhibit the early stages of biofilm development by preventing attachment of the bacteria to surfaces. The antibacterial activity of compounds 23 and 24 against a panel of mrsa strains was significantly greater than that of the reference antibiotics penicillin g and ciprofloxacin. Rhodanine-3-acetic acid - based compounds 27 - 28 are inhibitors of fungal protein : mannosyl transferase 1 ( pmt1 ) These compounds could serve as useful tools for studying the effects of protein o-mannosylation and its relevance in the search for novel antifungal agents. Rhodanine derivatives are novel inhibitors of phosphodiesterase type 4 ( pde4 ) structures 39 and 40 displayed the most significant activity of the compounds synthesized. compounds 4143 with activity against trypanosoma brucei are urgently required as potential therapeutics for the treatment of african sleeping sickness. 2,4-thiazolidinedione, ciglitazone 47 was discovered   by takeda chemical industries, ltd . , japan. It has antihyperglycemic activity in insulin - resistant animal models, kkay mice , and wistar fatty rats but no effect in insulin- deficient animal models of diabetes. The precise mechanism of action of these drugs remains unknown. Recent developments in the synthesis and evaluations of thiazolidinedione - based compounds for a variety of biological activities along with antidiabetes is discussed in the ongoing pages. Search for new compounds with fewer side effects and a more advanced profile than existing drug molecules is the main focus of attention for chemists and pharmacologists. Maccari et al. reported   new aris via in vitro evaluation of a series of 5-arylidene-3-(3,3,.3-trifluoro-2-oxopropyl)-2,4-thiazolidinediones 57 as aris.

There were no significant differences in the hpa-3 genotype distributions of patients ( aa=39.9% , ab=41.4% , bb=28.7% ) and healthy control subjects. Patients with acute ischemic stroke presented with coronary heart disease, hypertension, smoking history, and diabetes. Patients had higher levels of cholesterol and glucose compared with the control Subjects. A total of 306 patients with ischemic stroke met the eligibility criteria and were included in the study. 266 control subjects were also recruited. There were no significant differences in the hpa-3 genotype distributions of patients and healthy control subjects. Patients had higher levels of cholesterol and glucose compared with the control Subjects. There was no significant difference in age, cholesterol, and glucose levels. The presence of hpa-3 b / b significantly increased the risk of ischemic stroke > 2-fold ( p=0.008 , table 5 ) . in addition , the hPA-3b / b genotype might be a stronger risk factor for stroke among males compared with females. platelets play an important role in the pathogenesis of thromboembolic diseases. Smoking, dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, transthoracic echocardiographic abnormalities , and advanced age are all risk factors. The hpa-3 b / b genotype was a stronger risk factor for ischemic stroke among males ( p=0.032 ) than females. All donors expressed the gpiiia pla1 (hpa-1 a / a ) phenotype. Abciximab is a humanized murine monoclonal antibody iib / iiia receptor antagonist. Some studies have shown that the combination of a thrombolytic and a gpiib /iiia antagonist may have a synergistic effect on recanalization efficiency.  platelet glycoprotein iib / iiia polymorphism hpa-3 b / b is associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke in patients younger than 60 years of age. Our study suggests that more research should be carried out on gpiib /iiia receptor antagonist for stroke in young and middle aged patients.',\n",
       " 'Systemic sclerosis ( ssc) is an autoimmune connective tissue disease characterized by early impairment of the microvascular system. Microvascular damage and dysfunction are the earliest morphological and functional markers of ssc and are correlated with prognosis and therapy planning. The early ssc pattern is characterized by the presence of few giant capillaries , few capillary microhemorrhages , no evident capillary loss , and a relatively well - preserved capillary distribution. In the late pattern, there is severe capillary lost , with evident extensive avascular areas , ramified or bushy capillary , and severe disorganization of the normal capillary array.  nvc shows a regular array of capillary loops along the nailfold bed in primary rp. nvc also provides a semiquantitative assessment of microvascular damage that can be used to follow its progression. ldf measures local perfusion in a cubic millimeter of tissue ( capillaries, arterioles, venules , shunts)  flowmetry can be used to identify patients with secondary rp. Some studies have demonstrated that ssc patients have lower blood flow compared with healthy subjects. Lasca is based on the principle that when an object is illuminated by laser light , the backscattered light will form a random interference pattern made up of dark and bright areas.  peripheral bp , evaluated by ldf and lasca, correlates with the extent of the microangiopathy detected by nvc. when patients whose disease had been classified using nvc were then evaluated using ldf & lasca , those with the late ssc microangsiopathy pattern had a lower blood flow than that of patients with early or active ssc patterns. nvc is the best method to distinguish patients with secondary rp from those with primary rp and from healthy subjects.',\n",

       " \"Siblings of individuals with autism spectrum disorder ( asd) are at heightened risk of developmental problems in comparison to the general population. Asd requires substantial financial investment in therapy, medical treatment and early intervention education. micromanagement of the family environment to ensure minimal sensory discomfort and maintenance of a highly predictable routine. Review of the sibling literature reveals both positive and negative effects of growing up with an individual with a disability. Siblings of children with autism have been shown to do more poorly on a number of outcome measures in comparison to siblings of other developmental disabilities and those with only typically developing siblings. The purpose of this literature review was to summarise studies of the psychosocial impacts of growing up with a sibling with asd. A number of studies focussing on the functioning of the whole family in addition to studies targeting a range of developmental disabilities were considered. fourteen articles were accessed using key words to identify research within the sibling well - being field and further filtered in order to critically appraise the most relevant studies. Siblings of individuals with autism appear to be socially and emotional well adjusted according to a study. The addition of other typically developing children in the family appeared to buffer the negative impacts of growing up with autism in the home. It is not clear which gender or birth order constitutes a risk for psychosocial and emotional maladjustment. Risk of developing internalising behaviour problems is heightened in siblings of individuals with asd. Genetic vulnerability to asd ( broad autism phenotype ) was found to increase depressive and anxious traits only in the presence of high levels of stress. maternal stress and behaviour problems in the child with autism were not predictive of sibling adjustment. hetic feelings for their sibling with asd. Despite some positive emotions , the overwhelming feel of the sibling experience was negative. quality of life in families of children with a disability was significantly accounted for by a number of family variables. parental perceptions of the disability; experiences of family - centred professional support; perceived intensity of child behavioural problems ; and support from extended family members. Siblings of individuals with asd have been reported to conceptualise the self in a positively enhanced manner in comparison to the general population. A diagnosis of asd often brings with it a period of family loss : feelings of loss for the individual with the disorder, parental ideas and plans for their family 's future. Once the period of grieving is over , however, families often show great resilience in the face of adversity. Review revealed positive impacts of growing up with a sibling with asd contingent upon limited risk factors. Only four studies met the more rigorous criteria of quantitative study. The majority of studies involved children and adolescent samples. This creates a challenge in attempting to make conclusive remarks regarding adolescent sibling outcome and a complete lack of ability to comment on the adult experience. Communication within the sibling relationship and the  invisibility of autism emerged as important themes. Despite reports that the large majority of siblings of individuals with asd may be well adjusted , a significant proportion of the research indicates some vulnerability for behavioural and emotional dysfunction. This suggests that siblings need to be considered when planning interventions for asd. Research into the siblings of individuals with disabilities needs to meet certain vital criteria before the sibling community can reach a consensus. The true impacts of growing up with a sibling with a disability may be masked by samples containing too many confounding factors such as age and gender. Studies using systematic sampling procedures to identify participants within a narrow age range and controlling for confounding variables need to become more common. Psychosocial outcome and qol are related , but distinct constructs. qol can still be affected in the presence of normal levels of psychosocial health. future research using demographically disadvantaged siblings is warranted. many family and child factors have been linked to poorer outcome in siblings of individuals with a disability.\",\n",
       " 'in orthodontics the term torque can be used to refer to the buccal - lingual root inclination of a tooth. Many factors have been found or thought to affect torque expression, including torsion magnitude, wire composition, torsional stiffness, wire dimension, wire / bracket slot play, tooth inclination, interbracket width ( wire length ) and bracket deformability. clinically effective torque moments for lingualRoot movement of an upper central incisor have been reported as 520 nmm. The objective of this study was to demonstrate clear evidence of bracket deformation as a result of applied torsional loads. This pilot study investigated these phenomena using a novel imaging system that was added to an existing single axis torsion device. A similar approach was used for full - field polymerization shrinkage and depth of cure of dental composites. To investigate the interaction of the archwire with the bracket while under torquing an imaging system was adapted to work in conjunction with the single axis torsion rig. to quantify the separation of the tie wings , an image correlation technique was used on the collected images to measure the relative motion of objects in the image between frames. All data acquisition and control of the experiment was carried out using the custom software. The total rotation and the number of measurement points for the experiment were predetermined and loaded before experiment execution. Data were collected both as torque was applied to the bracket and as it was relieved , which led to a total of 36 data points. The amount of applied torque by the archwire in terms of the applied angle is given in individual captions. evidence can also be seen in the images of separation of tie wings as torque is applied. As the wire is rotated , a gap opens up between the archwire and tie wing 3. This is the largest in figure 5(j ) at the maximum rotation of the arch wire. quantitative measurement of the relative displacement between the tie wings can be made by averaging the displacement vectors. The experimental device described in this paper will be used in future research to evaluate bracket plastic and elastic deformation with various bracket designs. The relationship between wire torsion , torque force moment magnitude , and bracket deformation will be investigated. Data obtained from this experimental device can be used to validate finite element modeling of stress and strain in orthodontic brackets.',\n",
       " ' reductions in leg strength have been observed during concentric and isometric actions. positive correlations between lower leg strength and walking tolerance have been identified. interventions to improve eccentric strength and endurance might also be useful in improving exercise tolerance in these patients. This is the first study to analyze the effect of peripheral arterial disease in eccentric strength. etic dynamometer ( cybex , division of lumex , ronkonkoma , new york ) in both concentric and eccentric modes. Both action modes were tested in the supine position with the knee flexed at 90 and with the thigh supported by a custom apparatus. Peak torque ( pt) and total work ( tw) during plantar flexion was measured during maximal voluntary contractions at a speed of 120/s. 8 patients were tested unilaterally. The tests were carried out using a cybex 6000 isokinetic dynamometer. The order of leg testing ( symptomatic or asymptomatic ) and action types ( concentric or eccentric ) were randomly determined. Patients were allowed to practice three submaximal and two maximal trials before each test. The highest pt assessed over five consecutive repetitions was considered for analysis. The main findings of this study were ( i) patients with unilateral ic exhibited significantly lower concentric pt and tw in the symptomatic compared with the asymptomatic leg and ( ii) there were no differences in eccentric pt or tw between symptomatic and asymPTomatic legs. This study is one of the few to analyze strength and endurance during concentric action in patients with ic. The lower tw in the symptomatic leg compared with the asymptomatic leg during concentric action in patients with ic was previously observed in studies analyzing lower10 and upper leg regions. The reduction in eccentric strength with aging seems to be less pronounced than that in concentric strength. The reduced muscle strength and endurance have been associated with impaired walking tolerance in ic patients.  strength and endurance in symptomatic leg of patients with intermittent claudication is reduced in concentric , but not in eccentric action as compared to the asymptomatic leg. future studies are recommended to investigate the mechanisms underlying these responses and to analyze the effects of interventions to improve concentric strength.',\n",
       " 'Diphtheria toxin receptor ( dtr ) expression was limited to the descendents of the metanephric mesenchyme. With low sublethal doses of dt , we were able to limit injury to the early proximal tubular s1 and s2 segments. There were no podocyte abnormalities or other glomerular tuft pathology. After three doses of dt there was maladaptive repair over time with development of a chronic interstitial infiltrate and increased myofibroblast proliferation. ultimately , the inflammation resolved and there was little , if any , residual interstitial inflammation , expansion , or matrix deposition. thus , recurrent specific tubular injury leads to a pattern very typical of ckd in humans. Primary tubular injury can trigger a response that adversely affects multiple compartments of the kidney. This leads to a positive feedback process involving loss of capillaries, glomerulosclerosis, persistent ischemia, tubular atrophy, increased fibrosis , and ultimately kidney failure. There are a number of mechanisms by which paracrine effects mediated by a damaged kidney epithelium can lead to changes in the interstitium. An important mechanism relates to arrest of the cell cycle in damaged cells that can not undergo adaptive repair. Some senescent cells that do not express p16 can resume growth after inactivation of p53. Some tubular cells stay arrested in the g2/m phase leading to the production of pro - fibrotic factors such as connective tissue growth factor ( ctgf ) and tgf-1. The percentage of cells that have entered the cell cycle that undergo g2 /m arrest correlates with the extent of development of fibrosis. Few cell cycle regulators have been studied during the recovery phase after aki. p21 ( cip1/waf1) was one of the first proteins explored. After aki, p21 is upregulated both at the mrna and protein levels in the kidney. The precise role of each cyclin and its regulators during aki deserves a good deal more investigation. The greater hyperplastic response and protection against renal dysfunction or interstitial fibrosis after partial renal ablation in p21/ mice may be related to a reduced amount of cell cycle arrest. stmn , ( stathmin)-deficient mice have a defect in proper formation of the mitotic spindle and a propensity toward g2/m arrest after injury. It is possible that normal nonfibrotic repair depends on efficient dedifferentiation of the surviving epithelial cells. In each of the aki models we used in our study , whether resulting in fibrosis or not , there was an increase in apoptosis after injury. insulin - like growth factor - binding protein 7 induces g1/g2 cell cycle arrest and cellular senescence. timp2 inhibits endothelial cell proliferation and hence is antiangiogenic , which may contribute to maladaptive repair.',\n",
       " 'afferent loop obstruction ( alo ) is a rare complication of pancreaticoduodenectomy ( pd ) with a reported incidence varying from 1.2 to 13% . pannala et al. reported 24 ( 13% ) patients who developed alo among 186 pancreatic cancer patients treated with pd. When endoscopic assessment of the afferent loop is limited, such as in cases of roux - en - y reconstruction, reconstruction of the loop is a feasible management option. The patient had a fixed filling defect at the hj and pj with associated postobstructive hepatic and pancreatic duct dilation. Radiation enteritis of the afferent loop and/or the overlap of radiation enteritis and local recurrence in the length of involvement were presumed to be the causes of the obstruction. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged home on postoperative day 9. The patient was alive and asymptomatic at a follow up time of 11 months.  radiation - induced alo is an infrequent complication of pd and adjuvant radiotherapy. The literature on management of this complication is limited. A roux - en - y reconstruction compared to conventional loop reconstruction limits endoscopic access to the afferent loop. Reoperation rates vary from 4 to 11% among small - volume series.  reconstruction of the obstructed afferent loop is generally considered to be a more invasive operation. A smaller operation , such as bypass surgery , is adequate , less dangerous and more reasonable. reconstruction should be considered as a therapeutic option in the following two circumstances. First, if theObstructed loop is inaccessible by endoscopy and bypass surgery can not be performed. Second, if endoscopic interventions are unsuccessful in cases of conventional loop reconstruction and bypass Surgery can not been performed.',\n",

Patients with life - threatening arrhythmias like multifocal ectopic beats should be considered for therapy with fab fragments as fab fragments are not widely available. resin hemoperfusion has been shown to be useful in managing patients with various intoxications including tricyclic antidepressant and mushroom poisoning.',\n",
       " 'Superselective coil embolization is an effective , minimally invasive procedure for the treatment of intratumoral hemorrhage in renal angiomyolipoma ( aml) It remains unknown which is the most appropriate emblization material to use when the hemodynamics of a ruptured aneurysm resemble those of a high - flow renal arteriovenous fistula due to direct communication with the renal vein. The patient was discharged 10 days after embolization and her clinical course was uneventful. A 66-year-old woman developed low - grade fever that persisted for 10 days. After 1 week the fever had increased to > 38c and left flank pain had developed, so she was referred to our hospital. A 38-year-old woman developed acute , severe pain from the left neck to the lower back during exercise. Left renal angiography confirmed the presence of a ruptured intratumoral aneurysm creating the av fistula. An additional tumor - feeding artery was embolized with gelpart to reduce the tumor size. A 66 -year-old woman developed low - grade fever that persisted for 10 days. After 1 week the fever had increased to > 38c and left flank pain had developed. She was referred to our hospital. upon admission she describedleft flank pain and abdominal fullness. Her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature.  renal amls are common benign neoplasms composed of fatty tissue and smooth muscle. 6880% of patients become symptomatic if the tumor reaches 4 cm in size. Patients with a ruptured aml often present with acute pain as a result of hemorrhage. 20% are in hypovolemic shock at the time of initial presentation. Transcatheter arterial embolization is an effective first - choice therapy for the treatment of spontaneous intratumoral hemorrhage in aml. It is preferable to open or laparoscopic approaches such as tumorectomy and nephrectomy. The use of particle- or liquid - based embolisation materials requires careful consideration because these materials can pass through the kidneys and tumor to the lungs.',\n",
       " 'early progressive mobilization of adult intensive care unit ( icu ) patients has been shown to be safe and feasible. Early mobilization results in reduced delirium, improved functional outcomes, reduced hospital length of stay,3,6 and reduced mortality in patients with acute respiratory failure. Our 31-bed mixed tertiary icu had 1,976 admissions in 2015 , with 50% requiring mechanical ventilation. If sedation can be weaned or barriers to mobilization overcome, this is prioritized by the mdt early in the day to facilitate mobilization. Treatment dosage and intensity should align with the specific goals of treatment for the individual patient. Patients are able to rate their perceived exertion,19 this can be helpful in guiding treatment intensity. Once the decision to actively mobilize a patient is made , the next step requires the physiotherapist to complete a functional assessment. This includes a sitting balance and strength assessment. If the patient does not have at least 3/5 ( oxford scale ) strength in their lower limbs or safe unsupported sitting balance , the patient commences phase 1 mobilization. This can involve sitting balance retraining, strength training including the use of weights or slings, and/or treatment on the tilt table.  mobilization is progressive both within and between treatments to achieve functional goals ( figure 1 , phase 2 mobilization ) for some chronically critically ill patients , following discussion and planning with the mdt , it has been possible to complete rehabilitation sessions outside of the bed space. invasive mechanical ventilation should not be a barrier for mobilization and has been shown to be safe and feasible. The minimum number of staff required to mobilize a ventilated patient in our icu is two ( one bedside nurse for the airway and one physiotherapist for the patient) Airway clearance is recommended prior to any mobilization. If mobilizing a patient with a high sputum load, portable suction must be available. Patients who are awake but must remain on bed rest are assessed for their suitability to complete an in - bed exercise program. physiotherapists liaise closely with surgical and medical teams to clarify movement restrictions and duration of bed rest. if the patient is unable to follow commands and actively participate in mobilization, he or she may be suitable for passive mobilization.  mobilization is progressive both within and between treatments to achieve functional goals ( figure 1 , phase 2 mobilization ) for some chronically critically ill patients , following discussion and planning with the mdt , it has been possible to complete rehabilitation sessions outside of the bed space. invasive mechanical ventilation , whether through an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube , should not be a barrier for mobilization.  mobilization of an icu patient requires coordination of the patient, several staff , and equipment. 3060 minutes is a reasonable time frame to allocate for mobilization of a ventilated patient. mobilization should be timed to coincide with medication peak effectiveness. The safe weight limit of all equipment should be checked with the patient s body weight.  discussion with the icu medical team prior to mobilization is recommended for any patient with an identified difficult airway. portable suction must be available if mobilizing a patient with a high sputum load away from the bed space. The number of staff required to safely mobilize a critically ill patient is risk - assessed on the basis of the patient s functional assessment. 3060 minutes is a reasonable time frame to allocate for mobilization of a ventilated patient, including preparation time. mobilization should be timed to coincide with medication peak effectiveness where applicable. equipment requirements may include portable monitoring, overhead ceiling - mounted tracking or portable sling lifters.

The minimum number of staff required to mobilize a ventilated patient in our icu is two ( one bedside nurse for the airway and one physiotherapist for the patient) No member of our mdt routinely performs passive range of motion exercises given the absence of evidence that these reduce or prevent contractures in critically ill patients. We aim to sit our patients out of bed for a minimum of 4 hours per day with pressure care performed in the chair. Although there is evidence in favor of early mobilization, substantial barriers exist in many icus. Review of sedation practices may be a key step in increasing mobilization in critically ill patients. A strategy to reduce heavy sedation and increase mobilization in medical icu patients has been shown to be safe, reduce delirium , improve function and reduce icu and hospital length of stay. optimizing sedation to facilitate mobilization clearly requires close multidisciplinary collaboration between medical, nursing and physiotherapy staff.  guided clinical reasoning and practical considerations described in this paper will provide tools that allow frontline clinical staff to implement early mobilization in the majority of critically ill patients in a safe and effective manner. The paper provides tools that will allow frontline staff to. implement early mobilized in the most of the critically ill. patients in an effective and safe manner.',\n",
       " 'urothelial cancer of the bladder is the fourth most common malignancy diagnosed in american men. intravesical bacillus calmette - gurin ( bcg) is so far the most effective and common form of adjuvant therapy for high risk bladder cancer. otic pathways with combination treatment of gemcitabine and trail in urothelial cancer cells. The ultimate goal of cancer therapy is to achieve maximal antitumor efficacy and minimal toxicity. To reach this goal , we investigated the antitum or efficacy of some alternative modalities including gem citabine , ifn- , il-2 , alone or in combination with bcg. ilized powder of gemcitabine ( eli lilly canada inc . , toronto , on ) was first reconstituted with saline , aliquoted and stored at 20 c. These aliquots were further diluted to the desired concentrations with dulbecco s phosphate buffered saline ( pbs , ph 7.4 ) before each experiment. Female fischer f344 rats weighing 150 gm were used for tumor implantation and randomly assigned to experimental groups. The ay-27 cell line was originally induced in the bladders of fischer f344 rats by using the fanft carcinogen. The cells were cultured as monolayers in rpmi-1640 medium ( gibco - brl ) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum in 37 c humidified 5% co2. After the animals completed the treatment regimes , they were observed for more than 90 days for signs and symptoms of bladder cancer progression. 23 connaught strain bcg was initially provided by aventis pharmaceuticals ( formerly pasteur - merieux connaught , montreal , qc , canada ) It was assayed for colony forming unit ( cfu ) quality by the manufacturer and our treatment aliquots were based on these functional calculations. our hospitals later switched over to use tice strain bcG ( oncotice , organon canada ltd . , accordingly , we used tice strains in the second part of the animal study. Nearly 100% tumor engraftment has been achieved in syngeneic fisher f344 rats if 2  10 or more tumor cells are inoculated. A purse - string suture was placed in the skin around the urethral meatus to keep the solutions in the bladder while the animals were under anesthesia. 0.5 ml of normal saline was flushed into the bladder and collected for cytology. A 9.4 t rodent magnetic resonance imaging ( mri) was used to monitor bladder tumor growth. High - dose bcg attained significant survival benefit compared to control ( p = 0.03 ) , while low - doses bcg did not. When combining  bcg with il-2 similar efficacy was obtained. during and after bcg therapy, animals showed various degrees of distress ( ocular porphyrin staining , hematuria and poor grooming ) Animals treated with bcg ( tice strain , 2  10 cfu / ml ) instillations showed a significant survival advantage ( 66.7% lts , p = 0.002 ) and tumor cure ( tumor - free in lts ) compared with saline controls. Animals receiving gemcitabine ( 0.5, 1, and 2 mg / ml) also attained 7090% long - term survival and 4060% tumor cure. Combining bcg with ifn- did not enhance effectiveness over high - dose bcg monotherapy. There are limited proven effective alternative intravesical therapies for patients with bcg - refractory bladder cancers. The doses of bcg used clinically are largely empirical and there is limited data in literature to show that bcg efficacy is dose - dependent. We used a well characterized syngeneic rat orthotopic bladder tumor model to examine gemcitabine as an alternative chemotherapeutic agent. Gemcitabine and inf- are not infectious agents and can be used earlier than bcg in the clinic. The tumors tended to have early invasion ( pt1 disease ) beyond 6 days. Both strains of high - dose bcg showed highly effective antitumor activity. Animals treated with high concentrations of gem citabine ( 1020 mg / ml) could not tolerate beyond 2 instillations and died from drug related toxicities. Combining high - dose bcg with gemcitabine or ifn- did not further increase their antitumor efficacy over monotherapy of either agent. It seems that a maximal antitumors activity of the monotherapy has been reached and there is limited room for further improvement from combining them in our model system. If this is the case, rational combination therapy is more suitable for low - doses bcg plus gemcitABine or th1 cytokines in the treatment of early stage bladder cancer.',\n",
       " '70 adult patients of either sex were enrolled for this study. The patients were predominantly postsurgical who were operated for major abdominal , gynecological or urological procedures under general anesthesia. The anesthetic technique was individualized by the anesthetist in - charge. fentanyl alone was used for intraoperative analgesia and the dose was recorded. epidural or spinal technique was not used in any patient. Physical examination, baseline vitals, electrocardiogram and central venous pressure ( cVP) were noted on admission to the icu. Hemodynamic parameters were recorded at 10 min , 30 min after the commencement of sedative infusions and then 2 hourly for the study period. The degree of sedation was assessed by ramsay sedation score ( rss) 70 adult patients of either sex were enrolled for this study. The main inclusion criteria were age > 18 years, mechanical ventilation with endotracheal intubation and clinical need for light or moderate sedation for < 24 h. The patients were predominantly postsurgical who were operated for major abdominal , gynecological or urological procedures under general anesthesia. Group c patients were administered an iv infusion of clonidine 1 g / kg / h and titration was achieved with dosage increments up to 1 g. Dexmedetomidine was supplied in 2 ml ampoules that contained 100 g / ml diluted with normal saline to a concentration of 4g / ml. The degree of sedation was assessed by ramsay sedation score ( rss ) obtained on arrival in the icu. 70 adult patients of either sex were enrolled for this study. The main inclusion criteria were age > 18 years, mechanical ventilation with endotracheal intubation and clinical need for light or moderate sedation for < 24 h. The patients were predominantly postsurgical who were operated for major abdominal , gynecological or urological procedures under general anesthesia on an elective basis. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups, group c and d, based on computer generated random number tables. epidural or spinal technique was not used in any patient. baseline vitals, electrocardiogram and central venous pressure were noted on admission to the icu. hemodynamic parameters were recorded at 10 min , 30 min after the commencement of sedative infusions and then 2 hourly for the study period. Over a period of 18 months, 70 patients were enrolled in the study to receive sedation with either dexmedetomidine ( n = 35 ) or clonidine. These included 59 postsurgical , 7 medical and 4 polytrauma patients evenly distributed in each group. demographic data and intraoperative details such as operative time, fentanyl requirements, apache ii scores were comparable.  median dose of diazepam required in group c was significantly higher compared to group d ( 15 mg ) Need for additional sedation was about 43% less in group d. Median infusion dose was 0.4 g / kg / h ( group d ) and 1.4g / kg/ h (group c) The hemodynamic parameters were comparable between the two groups during the study period ( p > 0.05 ) systolic blood pressure ( mean  standard error of the mean ) during dexmedetomidine and clonidine infusion and after discontinuation was comparable. bradycardia occurred in 3 of the 35 patients in. group c and 4 of the35 patients in group d ( p = 0.64 ) hypotension occurred in 11 of the. 35 patients  in group c ( 31% ) and 3 of. the 35 Patients in group D ( 9% ) ( p=0.01) Dexmedetomidine is 8 times more specific for 2 receptors than clonidine. The improved specificity for the 2 adrenoreceptors may make it to be a much more effective sedative. The short distribution half - life of dexmedetmidine ( 6 min ) makes it an ideal drug for iv titration. Dexmedetomidine has been approved by food and drug administration as a sedative in the icu for patients undergoing mechanical ventilation of < 24 h duration. The study was an open - label study so there is an inherent potential for observer bias. The unavailability of bispectral index ( bis ) at our center we restricted our assessment of the degree of sedation to rss. Further trials with both drugs may define their exact role for sedation of icu patients.',\n",
       " 'Parallel pathways arise from three distinct divisions of the medial geniculate body ( mgb) in bats. The hypothesis that parallel thalamocortical pathways are involved in different aspects of hearing is supported by studies in three species of bats from different families. The mustached bat auditory cortex contains a primary auditory cortex ( a1) with a tonotopic map.  labeling was found in the rostral pole nucleus of the horseshoe bat. In the mustached bat, the mgbd projects mainly to regions dorsal to a1 that contain the combination - sensitive neurons used in target distance computation. The mgbv projects diffusely but more to the non - primary cortex than primary cortex. In adult pallid bats, the hfr involved in echolocation behavior receives input from the sg and mgbd , but not themgbv. The pallid bat localizes terrestrial prey by listening to prey - generated noise. It uses a downward frequency modulated ( fm ) sweep ( 60   30  khz ) for prey localization it depends on noise transients ( 540 khz) The majority of inputs to the lfr and hfr in adult pallid bats arise from different divisions of the mgb. The existence and functional significance of parallel thalamocortical pathways are established. Very little is known about the development of these pathways between the mgb and the auditory cortex. The pallid bat is suited to address the development and functional organization of auditory cortex, including frequency representation. The development of parallel pathways can be linked to representation of different behaviorally relevant sounds. In adults, functionally bimodal neurons are found near the interface of the lfr and hfr. In pups, however, they are more widely distributed. This suggests that projections from the mgbv and sg may show greater overlap in their cortical targets. We tested this hypothesis by retrograde tracing of mgb inputs. There is greater overlap in thalamocortical connections during early development. parallel pathways for noise and fm sweep processing are an adaptation for gleaning behavior in the pallid bat. parallel processing with strong filters will provide a substrate for additional segregation of the two auditory streams. The sg appears to be a phylogenetically and ontogentically malleable region of the thalamus. In non - chiropterans the sg is dominated by visual input from the superior colliculus. The sg of the mustached bat receives inputs from all frequency bands of the central nucleus of the ic. The pallid bat is the only animal we are aware of in which postnatal development of auditory thalamocortical connections has been examined. It is possible to modify echolocation experience during development ( razak et al . , 2008 ) . future studies will address how refinement of pathways proceeds in bats with altered experience with calls.  foxp2 may be a part of the molecular milieu of the sg that makes it developmentally and evolutionarily more labile. The authors declare that research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as potential conflict of interest.',\n",
       " 'intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy ( icp) is liver disease which could lead to premature birth, fetal distress and neonatal asphyxia. The best biomarker for diagnosis and follow - up of icp is up to knowing percentage levels of bile acids ( taurocholic and glycocholic acids ) over 40%. When the lung is damaged , the level of sp - a is increased through permeability augmented alveolus - capillary membrane and released to blood circulation. intratracheally injection of bile acid had been shown to induce severe pulmonary edema in rabbits. toxic effect of high concentrations of biles acid may influence the structure and function of multiple fetal organs. On day 13 of gestation, 1  ml blood was drawn from tail vein of pregnant rats to determine the levels of tba , alanine aminotransferase ( alt ) and total bilirubin ( tbil) On day 21 of gestation , cesarean section was performed with anesthesia by intraperitoneal injection of 10% hydral with dosage of 3  ml / kg. The number of fetal rats , the number of still birth , and fetal weight were recorded. The concentrations of sp - a in the fetal rat blood were investigated. Lung tissue samples were removed from 10% formaldehyde solution to the gradient alcohol dehydration , paraffin - embedded , sections ( thickness 4  m ) , and hematoxylin - eosin ( he ) staining. He stained sections were put under the optical microscope to observe morphological development of fetal lung. 6 fields of vision were randomly selected from each slice and analyzed by the image analysis system. No significant differences were found in tba, alt, ast, tbil, and dbil between group a, group b, and group c before intervention. The level of tba in fetal serum of group a ( 26.3  11.00 ) mol / l was significantly higher than that in group b ( 10.73  4.76 ) mol/ l , p < 0.01. The mortality rate of fetal rats in group c ( 3.77%) was significantly greater than that of fetal Rats in Group a ( 18.35%) In low dose group, normal structure of fetal type ii pneumonocyte was observed and microvillus outstanding cell surface fell off a little with clear cellular nuclear structure. mitochondria had slight swelling , enlarging volume , degenerated vacuolar , and disrupted or decreased crista. The number of lamellar body in alveolar space and alveolus type ii cell endochylema reduced , with some demonstrating vacuolization ( figure 1(c) ) . for high dose group , immature fetal lung tissues with smaller alveolars space and thicker alveoli septal were observed.  mitochondria had slight swelling , enlarging volume , degenerated vacuolar , and disrupted or decreased crista. number of lamellar body in alveolar space and alveolus type ii cell endochylema reduced. cholic acid , one of the bile acid species we used in this study , may have toxic effects on a variety of cells.  bile acid could enter lung tissue by two ways in terms of amniotic fluid aspiration and blood circulation. There is positive correlation between tba of pregnant rat serum and that of fetal rat serum. The still birth rate in dose groups was significantly higher than that of the experimental group and blank control group. ase a2 ( spla2 ) is a key enzyme in the lung injury pathway. Study showed the accumulation of bile acids into the fetal rat lung. immature fetal lung tissues with smaller alveolar space were found in high bile acid group. A lot of sp - a leak into the circulation of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. There is significant negative correlation between the density of mitochondria intype ii alveolar cells and tba. because of the degeneration and necrosis of type ii alleolar epithelial cells , the synthesis of pulmonary surfactant was hampered and affected by the perinatal prognosis.',\n",
       " 'tuberculosis ( tb ) is the second most prevalent cause of infectious - related mortality right behind hiv / aids. Despite effective treatment , tb remains as one of the main public health problems around the world. In iran , the disease incidence rate since 1964 has reached to 13.71 per one hundred thousand cases in 2013. Study was performed in 2015. directive of integration tb control program in the public health network system was communicated to all provinces of the country in 1991. The incidence rate of sppt per 100000 by sex and age groups was considered as dependent variable. We also estimated the annual percent changes ( apcs) to measure trends of disease over time. This retrospective cohort study was performed in 2015. due to the notification legislation in almost all countries around the world, directive of integration tb control program in the public health network system was communicated to all provinces of the country in 1991. in 1995 , according to the international recommendations , directly observed treatment short ( dots ) strategy for tb program was notified to all medical universities. During 19952012 , there were 96579 sppt case notifications in iran ( male to female ratio : 0.99 ) of them, 19.5% were 014 years, 70.9% were 1565 years old, and the rest were over 60 years of age. incidence rate ( per 100,000 populations ) of smear - positive pulmonary tuberculosis by age groups , sex , and years of study in ira is shown in table 2. The incidence trend of tb is declining nationally , but the results of province studies might be difference. Five countries have experienced more than 10% reduction in the tb incidence due to the implementation of dots strategy. Political and social changes in the neighboring countries, particularly afghanistan ( afghan civil war in 19921996 ) caused enormous afghan refugees into iran during the years of war. Studies conducted in ethiopia and bhutan showed that the incidence rate of sppt in men were always more than women. The increasing of public awareness in terms of tb disease and improving health care services in our country could be important factors to increase the trend of identifying sppT among men. A downward trend in the sppt incidence was seen after the implementation of dots strategy and the results might be due to the success of the strategy. accordingly , the program should continue with more sensitivity and accuracy in the country. It seems that to achieve the set goals and high successful in tb control program , especially reduction in sppT , pay more attention to old age and males should be considered.',\n",
       " 'ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( ohss) is a well - known complication of assisted reproductive techniques ( arts ) It is characterized by enlargement of the ovaries and fluid shift from the intravascular compartment to the third space. tuberculosis is common in developing countries , and peritoneal tuberculosis ( tb ) which is the 6th most frequent extrapulmonary tb usually presents with ascites. Ovarian hyperstimulation is a rare complication of using gnrh antagonist protocol for ovulation induction in patients undergoing assisted reproductive techniques. It is seen as a sudden increase in the weight of the patient along with some pelvic pains. It can cause massive ascites and proceed to a pleural effusion leading to life - threatening dyspnoea. Ovulation induction might actually be a stress factor in causing flaring up of tuberculosis. estimation of adenosine deaminase ( ada ) in ascetic fluid has value in diagnosing tuberculosis. In our case though pcr and acid fast staining were negative for tuberculosis , the persisting low haematocrit levels along with rising ada levels led to the suspicion of tubercular ascites.',\n",

Subjects were excluded from the study if they had a family history of a first - degree relative with diagnosed diabetes, had a history of smoking , or were taking any medication known to affect either endothelial function or glucose metabolism. Subjects remained in bed 1 h before and for the duration of the study. ppler ultrasound measurements , an ultrasound system ( hdi 5000 ; philips medical systems , bothell , wa ) with a linear - array transducer was used with a transmit frequency of 12 mhz. two - dimensional imaging of the brachial artery was performed in the long axis 5 cm proximal to the antecubital fold. images were triggered to the r wave of the cardiac cycle , and the artery diameter was measured using on - line video calipers. A mixed meal was chosen to assess the physiological changes that occur in response to a typical meal. plasma glucose and insulin were measured at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min. at 60 and again at 120 min after the mixed meal, brachial artery flow ( doppler ultrasound ) and mbv and mfv ( ceu ) were measured. A suspension of microbubbles ( definity ; bristol - myers squibb ) was infused intravenously at a rate of 3.0 ml / min for 10 min. intermittent imaging was then performed at pulsing intervals ranging from 0.5 to 25 s. Data are presented as the means  sem , and statistical analysis was performed using sigmastat ( systat software , 2004 ) Plasma glucose levels were elevated above baseline for both lean and obese groups. There were no significant differences in the time course of changes in plasma glucose between the two groups. Plasma insulin levels rose significantly by 30 min in the lean group and remained elevated for the additional 90 min of the study. The obese group had a significantly higher baseline ( fasting ) plasma insulin level ( p < 0.001 ) and a greater postmeal area under the insulin - time curve than the leanGroup. The ingestion of a mixed meal significantly increased total muscle blood flow and mbv of lean , middle - aged volunteers and that both these vascular responses are blunted by obesity. Figure 3 shows the effect of the mixed meal on forearm microvascular responses. Despite hyperglycemia , muscle mbV rose significantly by 120 min in the lean group indicating muscle microv vascular recruitment. In contrast , mb v was unchanged in the obese group ( ns ) ( fig . when the data from the female subjects were compared , we found that the lean groups still showed a significant ( p = 0.02 ) increase in mb V ) The ingestion of a mixed meal increased total limb blood flow in lean but not in obese subjects. forearm blood flow did not change in either lean or obese subjects ( 4 ) The lack of a significant change in mbv in the obese group is unlikely because of increased muscle adiposity quenching the microbubble signal. Study found increase in forearm blood flow in lean subjects when muscle microvascular blood flow ( mbv  mfv ) was not altered. Failure of this microv vascular recruitment may be one factor that contributes to postprandial hyperinsulinemia associated with insulin resistance / metabolic syndrome. Findings suggest a physiological role forMicrovascular recruitment provoked by meal ingestion.',\n",
       " \"correct chromosome segregation requires that one and only one kinetochore assembles on each chromosome. To achieve this, a subset of proteins must specifically recognize and bind to centromeric dna. yeast have solved this problem in part through the activities of additional dna - binding proteins. The most important of these is the cbf3 complex, which binds to cdeiii.  cbf1p has structural similarity and limited sequence identity to cenp - b , which binds to metazoan centromeric dna and also induces dna bending. physical and genetic evidence suggests that mif2p , a protein with similarity to metzoan cenP - c , also binds to centromeric dna near cBF1p. However, despite the presence of dna - binding motifs, this protein has not been shown to bind directly to this dna sequence in vitro. based on identified physical interactions , it appears that inner kinetochore proteins do not associate directly with microtubules or the microtubule - binding components of the outer kineochore. Until recently it was unclear how yeast kinetochores attach to spindle microtubules. In metazoans, microtubule - associated motors play roles in mediatingKinetochore attachments and in subsequent chromosome movements during congression and anaphase a ( for review see heald , 2000 ) . however , yeast kip3p may be an xkcm1 homologue ( severin et al . 2001 ) , suggesting that it may function at kinettochores.  dam1p complex interacts physically with central kinetochore proteins of both the ctf3 and ndc80 complexes. binding map of the eb1 family , may also play a role in kinetchore function. bik1p is a member of the clip-170 family of plus - end tracking maps. Stu2p plays a key role in modulating microtubule dynamics ( severin et al . , 2001 ) . altered chromosome dynamics may reflect micro tubule defects instead of a role for stu2P in mediating kinetochore  micro Tubule interactions. The conserved mitotic checkpoint is the primary signal for this checkpoint in budding yeast. ipl1p protein kinase is essential for chromosome segregation in yeast. The work described here has led to the most detailed molecular picture of an intact kinetochore in any organism.

       " \"Primary sjgren 's syndrome ( pss) is one of the most common chronic , slowly progressing systemic autoimmune diseases. The main symptoms are keratoconjunctivitis sicca and xerostomia. This disease affects predominantly middle - aged women, the gender ratio being 9 - 10 to 1. An unfavourable histological finding was considered to be the most powerful predictor of mortality. Other listed factors included lymphadenopathy , palpable purpura , parotidomegaly , low complement 4 ( c4 ) levels , and positivity for rf and ana. type i autoimmune epithelitis  risk group was recommended in patients with parotodomegally, palpable pur pura, or hypocomplementemia.  immunoserological tests were performed at the regional immunology laboratory of the university of debrecen. The mean follow-up period was 11.4  6.2 years with a range from 2 to 37 years. There was no significant difference in the mean age at the time of pss diagnosis and in the follow- up period between males and females. When at least one egm was present, pss was diagnosed 3.5 years earlier on average than in the glandular subgroup. The three leading egms each affecting more than one quarter of patients were polyarthritis, raynaud 's phenomenon , and vasculitis. The onset of certain egms might precede the establishment of pss diagnosis even with 59 years. During the follow-up period, 51 ( 46 women and 5 men ) of our patients died. mortality of the whole patient population was almost 9 percent , with no significant differences between genders. cardiovascular events ( myocardial infarction , pulmonary embolism , and stroke ) were the leading causes. In our retrospective study , we reported on research outcomes of 547 patients with pss from one hungarian clinical immunology centre. No other research on pss patients with similar ethnical characteristics has been conducted in any east - central european centre before. Our pss population was the third largest , but it was the first when considering the patient proportion related to the whole population of the given countries. The influence of the gender , the presence of egms and associated diseases on the time of pss diagnosis was investigated only by our working group. In women, pss begins more often with tolerable sicca syndromes , explaining the delayed seek for help , while in men a severe egm may occur as the first symptom. with few exceptions , egms tend to precede the onset of systemic autoimmune disease , as if anticipating it. significant gender differences were found for two egms : polyarthritis with the predominance in males and raynaud 's phenomenon predominating in females. the presence of egms enabled an earlier establishment of the diagnosis. Chronic low - grade inflammation typical for pss might cause the remodeling of gut wall which explains the association with microscopic colitis , sarcoidosis , and itp. cryoglobulinemia can be considered a highly relevant immunoserological abnormality , the emergence of which in the follow-up period of pss significantly impairs survival ratios and increases mortality risk.

       " 'mycobacterium avium complex ( mac) consists predominantly of two species : m. avium subspecies avium and m.Avium intracellulare. Disease due to the mac is one of the most important opportunistic pulmonary infections most prevalent in immunocompromised patients. Early differential diagnosis of m. Avium is becoming increasingly important. Serodiagnostic techniques based upon recognition of species - specific proteins secreted by actively growing myobacterial bacilli. 14 kda protein and 81.6 kda ( katg ) protein have been recognized to be helpful in the differential diagnosis of m. avium infection. The present study was designed to identify , isolate and purify m. Avium specific secretory proteins and to evaluate the role of these proteins in the diagnosis. Mice were infected with 110 bacilli through intravenous route and bled in the 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks post infection. M. avium cfps was separated on the basis of charge using anion exchange column chromatography technique using deae sepharose cl-6b matrix. Approximately 510 mg protein of the desired chromatography gradient containing specific protein of interest was resolved and purified by high - resolution preparative sds - page. M. avium infected patients were selected from hiv positive population on the basis of culture positivity on the culture media and by a battery of biochemical tests. The m. Avium specific secretory proteins were subjected to indirect elisa with 1:100 dilution of sera of hiv tb patients. Protein of interest was resolved and purified by high - resolution preparative sds - page. purified protein was subjected to n - terminal sequencing ( ladder sequencing , concentration dependent ) using liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry ( lc - ms - ms ; bruker daltonics inc . ) The sequence so obtained was carried for blast search to detect the homology with other mycobacterial species. The 4-week stationary culture of m. avium subspecies avium, m. tuberculosis h37rv and m. bovis bcg isolated the cfps with a mean yield of 152 mg / l of the secretory proteins. The cfps resolved on 12% denaturing gel showed the presence of protein bands ranging from a molecular weight of 6 to 97 kda on sds - page. However, the protein band in the regions of 4550 kda seemed to be specifically present and absent from rest of mycobacterial species.  complex protein demonstrating three peaks in the mass spectra. molecular mass of these three proteins was 47.3 , 50.9 and 55.7 kda with the number of amino acids being 463 , 469 and 515 , respectively. The n - terminal sequence of all the three proteins are different from other mycobacterial species. When purified m. avium aro - tal - ast complex protein was subjected to indirect elisa with the serum samples ( 1:100 dilutions ) , 9 out of 10 mac positive patients had antibodies to recognize the protein , giving a percent recognition of 90%. Four samples that were positive for m. tuberculosis did not recognize this protein, confirming that this protein is specific to m. Avium infection.  antibody - based easy and rapid elisa test correlate with those of conventional time - consuming blood culture and biochemical tests. 4 patients with disseminated mycobacterium infection but blood culture negative had anti - aro - tal - ast antibodies in their serum. As they were not differentially diagnosed to be m. avium infected clinically , nothing can be acertained.',\n",
       " 'Llzo is a fast li - ion conductor with the nominal composition li7la3zr2o12 ( llzo) It has a garnet - based structure and occurs in at least two structural modifications. llzo shows a high ionic conductivity of about 10 s / cm at room temperature. It is an excellent candidate for use as an electrolyte in an all - solid - state lithium - ion battery. There is no clear understanding as to which sites are occupied by al in cubic llzo. neutron powder diffraction ( npd ) measurements were interpreted as indicating that al is located at an octahedrally coordinated site in the garnet framework. In order to understand the computational models used in this investigation, we provide a short description of the crystal structure of cubic Llzo. Three different structural models were used to make the calculations. The calculations were made with 17 different local al positions located among the 24d, 96h , and 48 g sites. All al positions were fixed during relaxation and all al ions are equivalent in the unit cell. No significant effect on the results was observed by choosing a different li arrangement. The atomic positions were optimized by minimization of the forces ( below 2 mry / au ) acting on the atoms simultaneously with the self - consistent - field cycle as implemented by marks. The behavior of al at different crystallographic sites was analyzed qualitatively by weighing the various al positions with their corresponding energy. The nuclear shielding tensor is given by beff = b0(1  i ) where i is a second - rank nuclear shield tensor. The resonance frequency of the nucleus of interest, i, is then given by vi = ( i/2 ) beff. The interaction of the quadrupole moment, q, of the al nucleus with a sufficiently large electric field gradient, also affects the central nmr transition. The shape of the nmr central line depends sensitively on  the asymmetry of the electronic charge density close to the nucleus. The most energetically favorable position of al in llzo is at the tetrahedrally coordinated crystallographic 24d position. A larger external magnetic field lowers the effect. a site would also be 6-fold coordinated with again three pairs of al o bonds with lengths of 1.90, 2.03 and 2.11 and a coordination volume of 10.69. The site preference energies for al at various structural positions between 48 g and 24d are shown in figure 3. The fits were used to calculate the boltzmann distribution , w(xi) ( see text ) , discussed below. ra ( figure 4 ) around al , slightly displaced from 24d and 96h ( figure 3 ) , were used to analyze the experimental  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 nmr spectra. al at the 24d site is energetically the most stable state, followed by al at 96h and 48 g. The site preference energies for the latter two are similar. Geiger et al. assigned the resonance at 81 ppm to al residing at the 96h sites. The position corresponds to al with the coordination polyhedra in figure 4 and the site preference energies in figure 3. calculated values are  referenced  to the global minimum given by  = 68 ppm at position 1. Al mqmas nmr spectroscopic measurements to investigate this resonance at 68 ppm for an al - doped llzo garnet synthesized at 850 c. Both resonances were assigned to tetrahedrally coordinated al at 24d in two different garnet phases. The two tetrahedral sites have slightly different distortions and  and cq values. slow al diffusion within the lattice is responsible for the disordering over the two sites. Al could potentially be incorporated metastably at 96h and 48 g as well as in cubic llzo. The exact thermodynamic state of llzo, as obtained in the various sintering experiments, is not known. It is possible that metastable structural states are obtained that can depend on a number of experimental factors. Al ion is located at 24d because of its large effective charge radius. We consider the coordination geometry around the 96h site in llzo, which has been described differently. We propose that al could have a number of slightly different local 4-foldcoordinations around the crystallographic 24d and 96h sites in cubic llzo garnet. NMR spectra\\xa0 observed in experimental  experiments. NMR is a type of light-emitting diatomic molecule. It has been used in the study of light in the form of nmr spectra. It can also be used to study light in other ways, such as light scattering.',\n",

Endodontic treatment [ figure 4 ] was done under rubber dam isolation. full thickness mucoperiosteal flap was elevated. granulation tissue was curetted in periradicular area. root apex was infected for a long duration and apicectomy was performed. Palatoradicular groove is considered to be an important contributing factor for the development of localized periodontitis. The groove had a funnel - like shape and irregularities on the external surface that promoted the accumulation of bacterial plaque and calculus. The progression of bacterial products through dentinal tubules could secondarily compromise the pulp tissue. This required both pulpal and periodontal therapy. Deep radicular grooves can predispose to pulp necrosis and the establishment of combined periodontic endodontic lesions.

Its symptoms are often nonspecific , and misdiagnosis is common. We experienced a case presenting as oliguria with hydronephrosis and ascites on admission that was initially misdiagnosed as obstructive uropathy due to metastatic cancer. The patient had mild leukocytosis ( 13,600/mm with 90% neutrophils ) and a normal platelet count. liver function and coagulation battery tests were normal. computed tomography ( ct ) without contrast media showed bilateral hydroureteronephrosis and a large amount of ascites.

       " 'The number of children with type 2 diabetes has increased worldwide in recent years and continues to increase ( 1,2,3) Several racial and ethnic groups are at a particularly high risk for developing type 2 Diabetes, including african - americans and asians. In Japan, the annual incidence of type 2abetes is 2.8/100,000 school children / year. The increased prevalence of obesity among school children is notable. . a family history of type 2 diabetes is strongly associated with the development of childhood type 2. diabetes. The ideal goal of treatment is physical and emotional well - being and near normalization of blood glucose values. Most patients improve hyperglycemia within one to three months after introduction of lifestyle changes. We prescribe oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin to patients who continue high levels of hba1c over 8.0%. glycemia through diet and exercise during a relatively short period. sulfonylureas ( tolbutamide , gliclazide , glibenclamide , glimepiride ) promote  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 endogenous insulin secretion. Glucosidase inhibitors ( acarbose and boglibose ) work by inhibiting the absorption of carbohydrates in the small intestine. Sulfonylureas ( glimepiride) are thought to exert their hypoglycemic effect by increasing peripheral sensitivity to insulin in addition to stimulating insulin secretion. In adults, secondary failure of sulfonamides is common, and the frequency increases with duration of the disease. Glitinides ( nateglinide) promote insulin secretion in a manner similar to that of sulfonyLureas, but their onset of action is shorter. Metformin does not promote insulin secretion, but decreases hepatic glucose output and peripheral insulin resistance. The most common side effects of metformin are gastrointestinal symptoms. Metformin should not be used in patients with known hepatic disease, renal dysfunction, hypoxemic  conditions, or severe infections.  insulin resistance is a central feature of most forms of type 2 diabetes. High doses of insulin lead to hyperinsulinemia resulting in weight gain while hyperglycemia is not reduced. The use of pre - mixed insulin once or twice daily or a combination with insulin and metformin is useful for glycemic control. Children with type 2 diabetes show clinical heterogeneity and therapeutic approaches to  them are heterogeneous. Some need either oral  hypoglycemic agents or insulin therapy for their glycemic control. A good patient - family - pediatrician relationship should be maintained to encourage good glycemic  control ( 7 )',\n",

       " 'The sustained profitability of an organization depends on its workforce job satisfaction and organizational commitment. very little research in the literature is available on the links between managers leadership behavior and employees job satisfaction. This study aimed to overcome this gap by investigating these variables in a group of hospitals in iran. The results of this research provide a better understanding of the relationship between leadership and employees. This research investigates the relationship between perceptions of hospital managers and employees regarding the leadership behavior of Hospital managers. The author developed a persian translation of these questionnaires by applying a sequential forward and backward translation approach. The final test version questionnaires were then pilot tested using a random sample of 40 hospital managers. This research investigates the relationship between perceptions of hospital managers and employees regarding the leadership behavior of managers. The questionnaires were found to be understandable and could be completed in about 20 min. The reliability coefficient was .8749 for job satisfaction and .7784 for organizational commitment. The scores of employee oriented and task oriented dimensions of leadership were varied between 15 - 75 and 20- 100. The questionnaires were developed using a sequential forward and backward translation approach. 950 persons were selected for this survey ( n=6405 , d=0.03 , z= 1.96 and s= 0.51 ) 832 questionnaires returned and from those, 814 questionnaires filled ( 85.68 % return rate ) The reliability coefficient was .8749 for job satisfaction, .7784 for organizational commitment and .8767 for leadership style questionnaire. Data were collected from 814 persons including 665 employees, 127 first line managers ( head of departments) and 11 senior managers ( hospital presidents) The majority ( n=340 ) of participants ranged between 31 and 40 years of age. Hospital employees were satisfied overall with their job with a mean score of 3.260 on a 6 scale ( moderate satisfaction) Employees in specialized hospitals receive more monetary benefits than those employees in general hospitals because of the type of expensive services provided to patients. Employee s job satisfaction in therapeutic and diagnostic departments was statistically lower than administrative and ancillary departments. There was strong correlation between the job satisfaction of employees and their gender, marital status, age, tenure , organizational position and received salaries. A negative association was seen between employees organizational commitment and their educational levels ( r = -0.126 , p=0.001 ) significant differences were obtained between age, tenure, organizational position, type of employment, received salaries and organizational commitment. The employee s organizational commitment in therapeutic and diagnostic departments was higher than administrative and ancillary departments. There was no correlation between leadership style of managers and their demographic. There was a significant statistically relationship between hospital managers management experience years and their employee oriented and task oriented dimensions of leadership style. There was a statistically significant relationship between employees job satisfaction and their organizational commitment. This finding is consistent with the findings of other previous studies in health care settings ( 24 - 25 ) Employees who work with patients reported less job satisfaction but more commitment in this study. There is a significant negative relationship between the education level of employees and their commitment with their organization. The effectiveness of participatory leadership can be examined from a cultural perspective. Hospital managers should consider the structure and culture of the organization in choosing the appropriate leadership style.  maslow s ( 1954) believes that human needs form a five - level hierarchy ranging from physiological needs , safety , love , and esteem to self - actualization. once individuals have satisfied one need in the hierarchy , it ceases to motivate their behavior and they are motivated by the need at the next level up the hierarchy. in this study , employees job satisfaction in relation to their salaries and benefits and working conditions was low. once these primary and basic needs are met , they would think about participating in management decision making processes. More studies of hospital employees from other countries are needed. The results of such studies can be very helpful in developing strategies to improve the global retention of hospital personnel. More studies are needed to enrich the literature on hospital employees job satisfaction and commitment. The study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.',\n",

The median cooperation rate and response rate among states were 75.0 and 52.5% , respectively. diabetes status was ascertained by asking participants,  have you ever been told by a doctor that you have diabetes ? participants who had an affirmative answer to this question were considered to have diagnosed diabetes. Age at cancer diagnosis was determined by participants self - report. smoking status was classified as current smokers ( have smoked at least 100 cigarettes during their entire life and smoked in the past month) or former smokers. heavy drinking was defined as consuming on average more than two drinks per day. employment status was combined with work - related physical activity to generate a new variable: employed at a job spent at work. Cancer prevalence ratios ( prs ) for cancers of all sites were estimated according to duration of diagnosed diabetes adjusting for selected covariates. Secondary analyses were conducted among men and women with type 2 diabetes to estimate unadjusted prevalence and adjusted prs ( 95% ci) for cancers.  territories collected data on diabetes - related information using the diabetes module in 2009. age at diabetes diagnosis ( years ) and current insulin use were determined by participants self - report. duration of diagnosed diabetes ( years) was calculated by subtracting age at diagnosis from current age. cancer status was ascertained by asking participants,  have you ever been told by a doctor , nurse , or other health professional that you had cancer ? yes  were asked the following question :  with your most recent diagnoses of cancer , what type of cancer was it ?  demographic characteristics included sex, age ( years), race / ethnicity ( non - hispanic [ nh ] white , nh black , hispanic , and nh other ) , and educational attainment ( less than high school, high school , or some college or above) Health insurance coverage at the time of survey was ascertained by participants self - report. smoking status was classified as current smokers, former smokers, and never smokers. heavy drinking was defined as consuming on average more than two drinks per day.  secondary analyses were conducted among men and women with type 2 diabetes to estimate unadjusted prevalence and adjusted prs ( 95% ci ) for cancers of all sites and cancer of specific sites / tracts in relation to duration of diagnosed diabetes ( < 15 vs. 15 years ) and current insulin use ( use vs. no use ) The demographic characteristics of participants in the analytic sample were similar to those with missing data. 24.8% were type 2 diabetic with current insulin use ( n = 2,854 men and 3,603 women ) . The population distribution of age at diabetes diagnosis was approximately symmetric around its median. There was an increasing trend in the adjusted prs for cancers of all sites by duration of diagnosed diabetes among men ( p < 0.0001 for linear trend) There was no statistically significant difference in prevalence estimates for diagnosed cancers of all sites across diabetes types ( all p values > 0.017 after bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons ) among both men and women with type 2 diabetes. The prevalence was estimated to be significantly higher among adults who had diabetes 15 years for colon cancer, melanoma, nonmelanoma skin cancer, and cancer of urinary tract among men. The prevalence estimate for cancers of all sites was 1.5 times higher among those who used insulin than those who did not use insulin. The association between current insulin use and cancer appeared to be confounded, in part, by duration of diagnosed diabetes. Current insulin use remained significantly associated with increased prevalence of skin cancer ( both melanoma and nonmelanoma ) among men and cancer of the reproductive tract among women. Population - based study focusing on the prevalence estimates of self - reported diagnosed cancer according to duration of diagnosed diabetes may provide additional support for a possible link between diabetes and cancer. Long - term exposure to diabetes - specific factors ( e.g. hyperglycemia or hba1c levels , insulin resistance , use of antidiabetes medications , health and behavioral risk factors) and possible synergistic effects among these factors may provide further support for the association. The risk of colorectal cancer is 30% higher and the risk of bladder cancer is 24% higher in people with diabetes than those without diabetes. The association between duration of diagnosed diabetes and cancers of the colon and the urinary tract was weak among women with type 2 diabetes. Previous studies have suggested that there are differences between men and women in colon cancer and bladder cancer survival and health - related risk factors.  inconsistent findings on the association between insulin use and risk of cancer in type 2 diabetes have been reported in recent clinical trials. A german cohort study suggested a dose - response relation such that those taking higher doses of insulin glargine ( lantus ) had an increased risk for cancer incidence compared with those prescribed human insulin.  duration of diagnosed diabetes may not represent actual duration of exposure to diabetes because people may be asymptomatic for many years before medical diagnosis. Misclassification bias of the diabetes and cancer status could have resulted in the underestimation of our results. Approximately one - fourth of adults with diagnosed diabetes had missing data, which may potentially introduce bias to our estimates.',\n",

The study investigated the effects of increasing doses of win 55,212 - 2 on 24-hour food intake and body weight changes. The aim of this study was to determine if exendin ( 9 - 39 ) , the glp-1 receptor antagonist , would potentiate their effects on appetite. Study was carried out on male wistar rats weighing 280 to 320 g. Animals were housed individually in plastic cages and maintained on a 12:12 light - dark cycle at 20c to 22c. Animals had free access to standard rat chow lsm and water. Each rat received a pre - weighed amount of pelleted chow and tap water every day.

The results of the experiments were analysed with statistical software statistica 8 ( statsoft , poland ) with the use of repeated - measures analysis of variance ( anova ) and post - hoc analysis ( fisher s nir test ) There were no significant differences in initial body weight or in the amount of food consumed by the rats among all the experimental groups. b1 receptor agonist , injected at doses of 0.5 to 2.0 mg / kg did not have any significant effects on 24-hour food intake. A dose of 4 mg /kg inhibited food intake and subsequently resulted in body weight loss. The inhibitory effects of a single dose of win 55,212 - 2 was temporary and lasted only 24 hours. Exendin ( 9 - 39) was found to enhance the orexigenic action of neuropeptide y and attenuate the anorexigenic effect of lipopolysaccharide. High doses of cannabinoids inhibit appetite and can be explained by their suppressive effects on gastrointestinal motility and gastric emptying. The decrease in food consumption in animals treated with both exendin-4 and win 55,212 - 2 could be the result of their additive , inhibitory effects on gastric emptying. Another possible mechanism by which both agents decreased food consumption is their suppressive effect on locomotor activity.

A recent joint keystone meeting provided an opportunity for reflection on the current state of play and future directions for systems biology. One of the largest subsets of systems biologists are the ' molecular cartographers ' - researchers who are systematically mapping huge datasets. Network mappers still have a long way to go to create a global view of the functional relationships between the genes of a eukaryotic cell. We can expect a flood of metazoan protein - protein and genetic interaction data over the coming years. We need to encourage the development of new methods that target classes of proteins that are not well represented in the current maps. cotte described a new method for screening the collection of deletion strains. yeast are printed at very high density onto a glass slide using a standard microarrayer. in a pilot screen they were able to use these ' cell chips ' to identify half of the known and 36 novel regulators of the yeast mating response. removing a single gene often results in the cell switching to an entirely different metabolic regime. Systems biology may be to allow molecular biologists to move beyond the constraints of studying only a few rather arbitrarily chosen model organisms and out into the diversity of pathologically , agriculturally or evolutionarily interesting species. Several other talks described approaches to mapping the cascades of phosphorylation events that occur within cells.  bork reviewed recent results showing that it is possible to study the biology of organisms that can not be cultured in a lab or even those that have never been physically isolated. Massive shotgun sequence data from microbial communities found in an underground mine biofilm, surface seawater, farm soil and a deep - seawater vertebrate skeleton were used by various groups to construct ' metagenomes ' The seven cisternae that comprise the golgi in the region are false - colored light blue, pink, cherry red, green, dark blue, gold and bright red. The endoplasmic reticulum is yellow, membrane - bound ribosomes are blue, free ribosome are orange, microtubules are bright green and mitochondria are dark green.\",\n",
       " 'from june 2008 to april 2010, nine patients with ats with or without c23 subluxation were operated. There were eight males and one female , with a mean age of 35.7 years. All patients underwent c2 pedicle arthrodesis with a pedicle screw fixation crossing the fracture lines. We corrected our angulations from the traditional method of 20 degrees to the expected degrees indicated in the preoperative scan. These inclinations were controlled by continuous plain radiographic imaging to keep the drill strictly within the c2 pedicles. in each of these trajectories , these wires guided the two 3.5-mm - diameter cannulated screws , with the thread only at the end. Patients underwent c2 pedicle arthrodesis with a pedicle screw fixation crossing the fracture lines. fluoroscopic imaging was available throughout the case and images were obtained whenever necessary to assess the bony anatomy. An approximate 8-cm posterior midline cervical incision from the craniocervical junction downward was made. icles . in cases where c2c3 reduction appears more difficult , a lateral mass plate can be added connecting the c2 pedicle screws to the two lateral masses on each side of the c3. following surgery , all patients were placed in a semirigid cervical philadelphia collar for a period of 2 weeks. plain radiographs and ct were obtained postoperatively on day 2 and at 3 and 6 months to assess fusion and the integrity of the screw trajectories and length. The pedicle of c2 is the segment that joins the body with the posterior elements and not the portion located between the superior and inferior articulating processes. The average dimensions of the pedicles usually do not differ, with the exception of pedicle length. The use of screws with partial threads has proven useful in patients with pseudarthrosis after failure of conservative treatment. We chose the superomedial border of the pedicle as a guide for screw placement instead of a structured algorithmic approach. We also relied on the preoperative 3d ct scans , which revealed anatomical variations and the fracture lines. This allowed the surgeon to modulate the degrees of angulations bilaterally from various dimensions. ial border of the pedicle is needed to decide the entry point , and the proper preoperative surgical planning using 3d ct scan imaging for evaluating the best screw length and degrees of angulations is highly recommended for safety. navigation replaces fluoroscopy and generates 3d volumetric data set that may be viewed as axial , coronal , and sagittal images of the spine. The data set can be downloaded for real - time intraoperative navigation.',\n",
       " 'Study area - posadas is located on the northeastern border of argentina ( 2723 s 5553w , 120 m above sea level ) It is the most populated city of misiones with more than 320,000 inhabitants ( national institute of statistics and census 2010 ) The mean annual temperature and precipitation in the area are 22.2c and 1,699 mm , respectively. The phlebotominae were treated with lacto - phenol and observed with an optical microscope. The lu. longipalpis abundance at each household was estimated using the number of specimens captured per trap - night. The spatial dependence of vector abundance was compared between the two years. The abundance was categorised into three levels based on previous research. Environmental data were obtained from three different sources: (i) land cover, (ii) household field characteristics recorded simultaneously with entomological sampling and (iii) google earth satellite images. Sandfly abundance according to the categories defined was calculated using the interpolated abundance values obtained from the kriging procedure. Twenty characteristics of the households were surveyed simultaneously with the entomological data. Three indices were created based on these characteristics : a vegetation index, a dwelling index and an animal index. The spatial dependence of the sandfly abundance was analysed including an autocovariation matrix in the generalised lineal model. description and unitsneighbourhood ( macrohabitat)  surface covered by herbaceous vegetation at 50/100/200 m ( % )  surfaces covered by unvegetated areas at 50-100-200 m.  number of unpaved streets around the block of the household ( 0 - 4)  water source distance ( rivers , streams ) ( m) More than 99% of the total captures ( from 282 and 310 of the sampled houses in 2007 and 2009 , respectively ) represented lu longipalpis. The presence of evandromyia cortellezzi ( 2007 : 8 individuals , 2009 : 11 individuals ) was also recorded. During sampling in 2007 , nyssomyia whitmani and nyssomysia neivai were observed. The abundance of lutzomyia longipalpis in 2009 was greater at sites with a higher degree of tree or bush cover and an accumulation of unused material in households. The spatial dependence of the vector abundance was significant in the model ( p = 0.03 ) and  the semivariogram created for the residuals of the models showed no spatial dependence. In the city of campo grande the abundance of lu. longipalpis increased 60-fold from 1999 - 2000 to 2004 - 2005 ( de oliveira et al . 2006a) from 2007 - 2009 the areas with an intermediate or high abundance of sandflies increased. The percentage of households with sandflies decreased during this period. Longipalpis abundance was the amount of surface area covered by trees and bushes around the household. We found no evidence of dogs acting as a risk factor for vector abundance. The presence of accumulated unused material within the peridomicile did provide a partial explanation for the abundance of lu. Large trees may offer a better microenvironment where sandflies can find appropriate refuge and breeding sites. Sandfly populations are concentrated in small areas where the food supply is satisfactory. The environmental models created for posadas may be used as a starting point when creating more - robust predictive models of vector biology.',\n",

       " 'The study included 22 synthesized thioamide derivatives with 1.3 and 1.2 ring of thiazole. The ei - ms spectra were recorded with an amd-604 mass spectrometer ( electron ionization at 70 ev ) The frequencies of stretching vibrations in the equilibrium states of the amidothione system typical of frequencies are also listed. All compounds were dissolved in 1% dmso solution and further dilutions were made applying 0.9% nacl. The sabouraud medium in the amount of 15 ml was poured into petri dishes of 9 cm diameter. The substrate in the following dishes contained the tested compounds of the concentrations from 200 to 6.25 mg / l . density of the suspension was determined using a densitometer ( biomerieux) Fluconazole and itraconazole were tested against candida albicans reference strains 10231 atcc and 200 fresh clinical isolates. Minimum inhibitory concentration ( mic mg / ml ) was determined on the classic sabouraud medium ( bio - rad ) Yeasts mics were determined by the agar dilution procedure according to the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. Biological assays were performed at the medical university of bialystok. The homo and lumo energies of compounds were used to determine the size of the homo - lumo gap. In majority cases, activity of tested thioamides against candida albicans was larger compared to that of the reference drugs used. Sulfur atoms of the equilibrium thioamide / imidothiole binding may be one of the most effective chemical moieties. The directional tautomerization resulting from the influence of heterocyclic systems has some impact on the electron states of sulfur atom. High correlation of the descriptors describing the thiadiazole ring with activity towards candida albicans was reported. In the mycological literature there are numerous studies on the resistance of yeast - like fungi to currently used antifungal agents. A correlation has been demonstrated between the amount of phospholipase produced and virulence in c. albicans strains and other yeast species. Some fungi such as mucor, rhizopus , aspergillus , penicillium and candida have the ability of releasing hydrolytic enzymes. The ability of a compound to react with the molecular target is independent of the mechanism of its action. These relationships were examined in research upon the activity of sulfonourea herbicides and imidazoline derivatives. The most active compound ( 1e ) in from the thiole group is characterized by relatively the lowest gap ( 9.41 ev ) ioamide binding shows the ability to form hydrogen bonds with the enzyme thioles associations as well as close and long - range hydrophobicity regulators. Similar results were obtained by karimian et al . when studying three groups of fungicidal 1,2,4-thiadiazoles. Group interactions make the character of interactions between particular groups within compounds closer. They can be used in a rational design of bindings for the synthesis after setting general dependencies defining their kinetic properties. , regardless of their level of correlation , make theCharacter of interactions within compounds. closer.',\n",
       " 'This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of malnutrition in elderly people attending a hospital outpatient clinic in turkey. it also aimed to explore the somatic, psychological, functional , and social or lifestyle characteristics linked to malnutrition. this study included 1030 patients older than 65 years of age who attended internal medicine and geriatrics outpatient clinics. The activities of daily living ( adl ) scale containing 6 items and the instrumental activities ofdaily living ( iadl) scale containing 8 items were used for an assessment of functional status. The adl scale questions self - performance status of 6 daily activities including bathing or showering, dressing, carrying out personal toileting, moving from bed to chair, bowel or urine continence , and eating. The iadL scale deals with instrumental activities that are more complex , including the telephone usage, shopping, cooking, housekeeping, laundry , transportation , ability to take medications and financial management. The presence of depression in the elderly people was assessed with the help of the geriatric depression scale ( gds) This scale is composed of 30 questions, and each question has answer options of  yes  or  no. Each answer in favor of depression is scored 1 point and the other answer scores 0 points ; the sum of the points is the depression score. This study included 1030 patients older than 65 years of age who attended internal medicine and geriatrics outpatient clinics.  demographic properties of the patients were also recorded during this interview. These included age, sex, height, weight, marital status ( married, single, widow ) , persons with whom the patient lives ( spouse, alone, children , relatives ) , income status ( low or high ) , social security status ( covered or not covered by health insurance ) , educational status ( illiterate and primary school graduates were classified as having a low educational status ) , comorbidities ( hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, chronic renal failure , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) , cerebrovascular disease ( cvd ) , osteoporosis and musculoskeletal system disease ) , the Mini nutritional assessment ( mna) test is composed of 18 questions with 15 verbal questions and 3 based on anthropometric measurements. The highest possible overall nutritional score is 30 points. If the individual scored 12 out of 14 points in the initial test , it was concluded that the person did not have malnutrition , and so the rest of the test was not used. The presence of depression in the elderly people was assessed with the help of the geriatric depression scale ( gds) The scale has demonstrated a high level of internal consistency ( 0.92 ) and a highlevel of validity (0.97 ) When the whole study population is considered, 196 ( 19% ) had malnutrition and 300 ( 29.1%) had malnutrition risk. The clinical and demographic properties of the study population based on categorical nutritional status and their statistical comparisons are shown in table 1. 18.9% of patients had depression, 124 ( 63.3% ) had polypharmacy, 106 ( 54.1%) had a low income level, and 151 ( 77.0%) had low educational level. The prevalence of comorbid conditions such as dm , hyperlipidemia , copd , and cvd were significantly higher in the malnutrition group compared to the other groups. Study is the first multicenter trial conducted in a geriatric patient population attending outpatient clinics in our country. age , low bmi , number of comorbid disorders , low educational level , and presence of depression were independently associated with malnutrition in this elderly population. depression is a common psychiatric disorder characterized by reduced appetite and self - care , apathy , and physical weakness. In western society, a comparison between elderly people living alone and having a low educational level and young elderly reveals that social factors have an important impact on nutritional status. The differences in our results may have stemmed from the differences originating from turkish demographic characteristics. diagnosis and treatment of individuals at high risk for malnutrition based on the results of this study may improve functional status , cost of care , and prognosis of elderly people.',\n",

Of the 69 participants 28 ( 40.6% ) had evidence of neuropathy ( impaired pain perception, vibration perception or pressure perception ) on clinical examination. prevalence of neuroopathy was higher among men ( 71.4% ) compared with women ( 32.7% ) The proportion of participants with sss for each type of neuropathic is shown in figure 1. Study corroborates the association between the sss and peripheral neuropathy. In particular its association with more severe neuropathy based on number of positive tests. In light of the strong association of neuropathy with the development of diabetic foot ulceration , lower extremity amputation , and charcot arthropathy, detection of peripheral Neuropathy is of paramount importance. Although sensory perception testing methods are sensitive in identifying patients at risk for foot ulcers. The sss allows the clinician to identify patients with severe neuropathy with a single question and no testing equipment. The sensitivity of the sss in this study was relatively low ( 28.6% for any neuropathy ) This may reflect a higher proportion of persons with mild neuropathy in our study compared to teelucksingh's original study.\",\n",

       " 'phosphorylation is an important post - translational modification performed by kinases that catalyze the addition of phosphate groups onto the target amino acids. The reversible phosphorylation acts frequently as a switch controlling various signaling processes. About 30% of proteins in eukaryotic proteomes can be phosphorylated. In arabidopsis thaliana, the number of coding genes is ~25,000 and there are 1,000 protein kinases. ructure - enriched lobe and a larger c - terminal -helix - dominated lobe. atp is bound to a loop ( p - loop ) connecting 2 -strands in the cleft formed by the n- and c - lobes. phosphorylation occurs normally within the intrinsically disordered protein regions ( idprs) ps and idprs may exist in multiple forms , such as extended or compact disordered species that contain smaller or larger amount of flexible secondary structures. Although the structural flexibility of the substrates seems to represent an important structural factor defining the efficiency of protein phosphorylation , the peculiarities of the correlation between phosphorylated and the extent of the flexibility has not been completely understood. This analysis revealed that sites with high pondr - vlxt disorder scores are very likely to have high pond r - fit disorder scores. All phosphorylation sites are organized into 3 different groups : buried, semi - exposed and exposed. The disorder score of a region flanking a sp.ecific residue is analyzed. This analysis provides description of the local environment of the residue / region of the interest. If a structured target site ( i.e. site with the disorder score below 0.5 ) is flanked by disordered regions, the site is likely to have a disordered environment. Fig. 1b suggests that almost all flexible phosphorylatable residues ( disorder score > 0.5 ) have decreased averaged disorder score for the entire region. In contrast, the majority of structured phosphorylated residues have increased average disorder score over the region. Figure 1b also shows that residues in the group ii that were characterized by higher pondr - fit scores systematically had higher averaged scores of their extended segments. Only a small fraction of phosphorylatable residues are located within -helices or -strands. The greatest majority of these residues can be found within the regions with irregular structure ( coils) The peculiarities of numerical distributions are further illustrated by table 1 where positioning of all thr , ser , and tyr residues in secondary structure elements of analyzed proteins are compared with localization. Only one out of 75 phosphorylation sites is structured and buried. phosphorylatable residues can be divided into 4 groups: exposed and flexible, exposed but not flexible, not exposed but flexible, and not exposed and not flexible. The highly flexible residues are more often associated with larger surface exposure. This suggests that some residues in this group are located within spikes. The averaged disorder score of an extended region centered at the phosphorylation site usually increases very fast when the length of the extended region is increasing. The only noticeable exception from this rule in figure  3a is tyr31 in q42438. This residue is located within a pretty long rigid region. Since the segment is extended on both sides , the total length with extension n is 2n+1. The phosphorylation mechanism of ser360 of q9lvm0 can also be attributed to local structural flexibility and surface exposure. ser360 has about 654 residues and is composed of the n - terminally located signal peptide of 40 residues, followed by the 5 leucine - rich repeats ( lrrs ) , atp binding site , and finally by the kinase domain at the c - terminal half of protein.  q9lvm0 is a putative receptor kinase containing five lrrs. q9fhk7 is another lrr receptor - like protein kinase. These 2 sequences are highly similar to each other with the sequence identity of ~50% ( see fig ) The flanking regions of the phosphorylatable threonines in these two proteins are almost identical. The phosphorylation of these 2 residues should be determined by similar mechanisms. The phosphorylatable thr is located on the surface of this amphipathic -helix. therefore, the side - chain of thr can be much more flexible and exposed than the neighboring backbone atoms. This observation is complementary to the traditionally accepted dependence of the phosphorylation efficiency on the protein primary structure. This study focused more on those higher order structural properties , than on the traditionally analyzed sequence. The phosphorylated tyrosine constitutes only several percent of phosphorylatable residues across the eukaryote proteomes. The phosphorylation of one of them can synergistically affect accessibility of two other residues. The effects of the residues that are not sequential neighbors but are spatial neighbors are of a special interest. The phosphorylation of s360 and t580 of q9lvm0 may influence each other. Another example is found in an inorganic phosphate transporter q8vym2. Since these 3 residues are cytoplasmic , their actual spatial distances could be very small. If this hypothesis is correct , then they will be able to affect each other . however , similar to other cases considered above , the available experimental are rather limited. The information on phosphorylatable sites in transmembrane proteins of arabidopsis thaliana were collected from phosphat database. database contains information on arabIDopsis phosphorylation sites identified by mass - spectrometry experiments performed by different research groups.

       " 'ductal carcinoma in situ ( dcis ) is characterized by proliferation of malignant cells confined by the basement membranes of ductal structures. dcis is considered a preinvasive form of invasive breast cancer that requires immediate treatment. With the widespread use of screening mammography, dcis now accounts for 15%20% of all newly detected breast cancer. The purpose of this retrospective study was to characterize the morphology and enhancement kinetic pattern of pure dcis on dce - mri. Since high - grade dcis is associated with a greater risk of local recurrence and progression to invasive breast cancer [ 2830 ] , it would be very helpful if the high -grade and low -grade dcis could be differentiated on imaging. The study was approved by the institutional review board and informed consents were obtained from all patients. The contrast agent ( omniscan , 1  cc/10  lbs body weight ) was manually injected at the beginning of the 5th acquisition and was timed to finish in 12 seconds to make the bolus length consistent for all patients. immediately following the contrast , 10  cc saline was injected. the subtraction images at 1-minute postinjection were generated by subtracting the precontrast images acquired in frame number 3 from the postcontrast - enhanced images acquired on frame number 6. the maximum intensity projections ( mips ) were also generated from the subtracted images to help identify the lesion. the enhancement kinetic was analyzed from manually selected roi ( region of interest ) based on the subtractions images at1-  dcis was classified according to the nuclear grade ( non - high grade versus high grade ) and the morphologic subtype ( comedo and noncomedo ) grade - i ( low grade) and grade - ii ( intermediate grade) were categorized as non -high grade, and grade-iii (high grade) was the high -grade. Two cases of high - grade dcis withNoncomedo morphology were not detected by mri and were false negative diagnosis. The shape, margin, and internal enhancement patterns were evaluated in 12 mass lesions that were 5  mm. The most frequently seen features were irregular shape ( 50% ) and spiculated / irregular margin ( 92% ) There was no significant difference in the mr morphology pattern between the non - high - grade and high -grade mass type dcis lesions.  correlation between screening mammogram and mr imaging was performed in 22 patients whose mammography reports were available. mammography may miss dcis that does not present certain suspicious patterns of microcalcifications. mri may have a complementary role in diagnosis of these lesions. Most false - negative diagnosis of dcis by mri appeared to be non - high - grade , noncomedo - type lesions. Nuclear grade has been consistently associated with poor prognosis and local recurrence in dcis. High - grade pure dcis missed by mammography can be diagnosed by mri alone. Pure dcis lesions often appear as nonmass clumped enhancement in a regional , ductal , or linear distribution. The peak enhancement ratio at one minute ( e1 ) for pure dcis was less than invasive cancers and more than benign lesions. We did not find significant difference between the enhancement kinetics of high - grade and non - high -grade groups. For the size measurement of dcis , different local recurrence rates were found between dcis lesions smaller and larger than 10  mm. The majority ( 94% ) of pure dcis lesions showed contrast enhancement. mri was more sensitive in detecting pure. dcis compared to mammography. However, we did not observe any significant difference in mr morphologic or kinetic features between non - high - grade and high -grade pure DCis.',\n",
       " ' accreditation is a process based on self and elite s assessment for guaranteeing and improving the quality and responsibility of an institute or university course. edcs were established in universities of medical sciences in iran in the late 90s ; their main aim has been to improve the education quality. The tasks of edc especially in recent years has been widening. In the 42 session of the council of education deputy managers on 17/12/2008 approved that only universities with standard edcs can apply to establish new educational program. special criteria were used to select the best candidates out of experts in the medical education field from the whole country. The team decided to design a set of standards in two levels which were basic ( essential ) and quality improvement standards. The basic standard means the required standard ( the musts ) which each center has to prove complying with. A new national committee was formed from among those who had appropriate scientific and experimental experiences and did not hold any executive positions in educational management of the university. Using cluster analysis , we assessed the similarities between the obtained scores for indicators ; then we classified indictors into clusters in a way to minimize the distance of scores for ever indictor from the centers of clusters. findings delineated that all medical - sciences edcs of iran were capable of taking part in the project and presented required data and information. ums in the area of faculty members development - modern assessment methods in the assessment area. The standards in the areas of faculty participation in projects ( management, website, clinical skills training, assessment of faculty member , and internal assessment ) had the best optimum levels.

       " 'qx-314 ( n-[2,6-dimethylphenyl carbamoylmethyl ] triethylammonium bromide) is a quaternary of lidocaine ( lido) It is difficult to permeate through cell membranes because it has a permanent positive charge. Some studies have shown that it can produce long - lasting local anesthesia with a slow onset. Ll-1 produced long - lasting sciatic nerve blockade in rats. The onset time of ll-1 was acceptable ( < 10 min ) However, severe cardiotoxicity after administration of local anesthetics always is lethal. We compared the cardiot toxicity of levo - bup, qx-314 , and qx - oh in anesthetized rats. We also evaluated the ability to resuscitate rats upon asystole. :10 mm . cd50c of levo - bup, qx-314 , qx - oh , and ll-1 was measured using the up - and - down  method. rats were anesthetized in a bell jar with 2% isoflurane in 100% oxygen. venipuncture was undertaken on the distal third of the tail with a 22 g intravenous cannula. In rat sciatic nerve block model , we used a hot plate experiment to determine the median effective dose required to produce sensory blockade ( ed50 ) rats were placed a left lateral position. An injection ( 23 g , 1 inch hypodermic needle ) was vertically inserted in the center of the line linking trochanter major and tuber ischiadicum of left leg. sensory block was measured in the same anatomic area using a modified hot plate ( model rb-200 hot plate analgesia meter ; chengdu technology & market co. , ltd . ) at a temperature of 56c. Arterial blood gas was measured to confirm a ph between 7.30 and 7.45 and a serum lactate < 2.0 mmol / l before administration of local anesthetics. Rats were assigned randomly to receive 1.2-fold cd50a in the 4 groups  a dose that reliably produces asystole from which hemodynamic recovery will occur with cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The study was approved by the committee of animal care of west china hospital. male and female sprague dawley rats were provided by the experimental animal centre of sichuan province. rats were housed in cages with free access to food and water and were maintained on a 12-h light  dark cycle. Rats were anesthetized in a bell jar with 2% isoflurane in 100% oxygen. rats were placed on a board under a warming lamp to maintain body temperature at 37c38c. venipuncture was undertaken on the distal third of the tail with a 22 g intravenous cannula. After injection , we observed electrocardiographic evidence of the toxic effects on cardiac automaticity. In rat sciatic nerve block model , we used a hot plate experiment to determine the median effective dose required to produce sensory blockade ( ed50 ) rats were placed a left lateral position. An injection ( 23 g , 1 inch hypodermic needle ) was vertically inserted in the center of the line linking trochanter major and tuber ischiadicum of left leg. sensory block was measured in the same anatomic area using a modified hot plate ( model rb-200 hot plate analgesia meter ; chengdu technology & market co. , ltd . ) at a temperature of 56c. Rats were assigned randomly to receive 1.2-fold cd50a in the 4 groups  a dose that reliably produces asystole from which hemodynamic recovery will occur with cardiopulmonary resuscitation. External cardiac compressions were applied immediately at a rate of ~300 beats / min to produce a systolic arterial pressure > 40 mmhg until spontaneous rhythm returned. simultaneously, epinephrine 10 g / kg was administered at 1-min intervals until return of spontaneous circulation ( rosc ) Data were analyzed using spss v19.0 ( ibm corporation, armonk , ny , usa ) The total sample of 32 subjects achieves 80% power to detect a linear trend using a 2-sided z test with continuity correction and a significance level of 0.05. baseline parameters of cardiac function, weight, tasystole, trecovery , dose of epinephrine required for successful resuscitation , and duration of arrhythmia ( % ) after rosc among groups were analyzed. A decrease in heart rate and widening of the qrs complex after administration of study drugs was observed in all groups. The cd50c was significantly lower for levo - bup than for qx-314 or qx - oh. Thirty - four rats were studied in experiment 3 , but 2 rats in the qx-314 group were excluded because they did not develop asystole. groups were similar in terms of weight , heart rates , systolic blood pressure , rpp , and acid - base status at baseline ( table 2) rosc was attained initially by 8 of 8 Rats in the levo - bup group. The dose of epinephrine required for successful resuscitation was 38.75 mg / kg in levo - bup, qx-314, and ll-1 groups. There were no significant differences in ph , partial pressure of carbon dioxide , or partial pressure. of oxygen among all groups ( p > 0.05) Thirty - four rats were studied in experiment 3 , but 2 rats in the qx-314 group were excluded because they did not develop asystole. groups were similar in terms of weight, heart rates, systolic blood pressure , rpp , and acid - base status at baseline ( table 2 ) . rosc was attained initially by 8 of 8 Rats in the levo - bup group. The number of rats achieving successful resuscitation increased significantly in levo - bup and ll-1 groups. No rats could maintain rpp 30% baseline in qx-314, qx - oh , and ll -1 groups at 10, 20, and 50 min after rosc. Asystole occurred again in some rats that had attained spontaneous circulation in all groups. There were no significant differences in ph , partial pressure of carbon dioxide , orpartial pressure of oxygen. Lactate levels showed significant increases in the qx - oh group at 15 and 60 min and in the ll-1 group from 30 to 60 min after resuscitation. The initial ability to resuscitate rats in which asystole had been induced by levo - bup was similar. However, it was more difficult to resuscitated rats after induction of systole by qx-314. advanced life support might be needed after rosc. Local anesthetics elicit cardiotoxicity primarily by blocking sodium channels. A mixture of bup and lido can impair the intraventricular conduction parameters to a lesser extent than that for bup itself. The si of levo - bup was significantly greater than that of qx-314 (10.60 vs. 1.20 ) or qx - oh ( 10.97 vs 10.40 mg / kg )  qx - oh and levo - bup produced the same or the lighter effects on cardiac functions under the same condition without affecting the potency of local anesthesia. The precise mechanism of this interaction affecting the cardiac conductivity or contractility was still unknown in this study. Asystole occurred rapidly in a fashion of disappearance of cardiac electrical activity after administration of levo- bup or ll-1. qx-314-induced asystole was relatively more difficult to resuscitate than qx - oh. sustainable arrhythmia occurred in qx- 314 , qx. - oh , and ll-1 groups after rosc. local anesthetics decrease ventricular conduction in a stereospecific manner and decrease contractility. We did not use lipid emulsions in our resuscitation sequence. epinephrine over a threshold dose near 10 mg / kg impairs lipid resuscitation from bup overdose. further studies are needed to define what kind of advanced life support is needed after rosc to maintain stable circular function.',\n",
       " \"Large - scale meta - analyses across multiple data sets have become the mainstream approach to genome - wide association scans ( gwas ) These studies have been successful in identifying common ( minor allele frequency ( maf ) 0.05 ) genetic variants that underlie a variety of phenotypes and diseases.

The association study was performed for each population separately using three different approaches. The classical single - variant analysis for each variant in the region was carried out. A collapsing method and an allele - matching association test were also considered. The latter two methods were locus - based tests, so that only a single test was performed. We used a one - way anova model at each variant. The similarity scores yl(ij ) between individuals i and j in group l are modeled. We then carried out a meta - analysis across the three populations. We used two different approaches : ( i ) or based ( fixed and random effects ) and ( ii ) p - value based ( fisher 's product method ) We report identified loci as the proportion of replicates that detect association with at least one causal variant. for the collapsing and allele - matching methods, 110 variant markers were tested and the threshold for variant - specific analysis was set to 0.00045 ( 0.05/110 ) In the setting of common causal variants with small effect sizes , the detection of causal variants or loci was unsatisfactory based on single - variant tests. The or - based fixed effects approach performed best with 22.7% power. The allele - matching method demonstrated clear power advantages with 74.7%. The power of individual locus - wide methods critically depends on the allelic architecture of disease. As the currently sparse set of next - generation sequencing empirical data for complex traits begins to grow, the need for powerful meta - analysis methods that account for heterogeneity increases.\",\n",
       " 'High - grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia ( hgpin) has similar histopathological characteristics to prostate adenocarcinoma. An initial diagnosis of hg pin before a later diagnosis of pca does not increase the risk of adverse pathologic features. praecancerous lesions such as carcinoma in situ of the bladder and lobular carcinoma of the breast are associated with adverse clinical outcomes. The value of concomitant hg pins as a prognostic factor in pca following a prostatectomy is under debate. All of the study patients had been preoperatively staged for metastases using contrast - enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and bone scintigraphy. The patients were divided into three groups according to their pathological gleason scores. Subgroup analyses were performed to investigate the clinicopathological features of these groups. All patients had been preoperatively staged for metastases using contrast - enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and bone scintigraphy. The patients were divided into three groups according to their pathological gleason scores. Subgroup analyses were performed to investigate the clinicopathological features of these groups. The characteristics of the pca patients with and without hgpin are listed in table 1.  bcr occurred in 11.7% of patients during follow - up-13.8% in the group without hgpin and 11.2% in group with hg pin. No significant differences found between the two groups in any of the other variables analyzed , including pathologic t stage , psa , presence of lvi , and lymph node involvement. Hgpin is associated with poorer clinical outcomes and the histological characteristics of pca. Patients with hgpin tended to have a higher gleason score , more pni , and more frequent multiple tumors. Previous studies have reported that tumor focality is not associated with the prognosis of localized pca . Although there are no reported clinical implications from recent studies, the association of hg pin with tumor focability was clear from our current analyses. gpin . based on the cumulative evidence to date , including our current findings , we hypothesize that pca derived from hgpin is more likely to progress to high - grade pca than \" de novo \" pca. before becoming a malignant lesion , hg pin similarly , pierorazio et al. suggested that hg pins is a negative prognostic indicator. Most instances of bcr occurred in patients with higher pathological stage tumors and higher gleason score tumors. Patients with hgpin were more likely to have multifocal tumors than those without hg pin. This finding supports our hypothesis that pca derived from hg pins will spread further and progress more quickly to a more diffuse malignant lesion.',\n",
       " \"According to the taiwan department of health , the cumulative death rates from coronary artery disease , stroke , and diabetes are 152 cases per 100,000/yr. This nearly equals the death rate from malignancies. The prevention and early detection of coronary heart disease and diabetes has become a major public health issue.  factor analysis ( 8 , 9) was used to investigate which of mets factors are related to ir ( sspg levels) The ability of insulin to dispose of a glucose load was estimated by modification of the ist. plasma glucose levels were determined using the glucose oxidase method ( ysi 203 glucose analy)  insulin levels were measured by a commercial solid phase radioimmunoassay kit ( 11; coat - a - count insulin kit ; diagnostic products corporation , los angeles , ca , u.s.a . ) The intra- and inter - assay coefficients of variance for insulin were 3.3% and 2.5% , respectively. Both triglyceride ( tg ) and total cholesterol (tc ) levels were measure using the dry , multilayer analytical slide method in the fuji dri - chem 3000 analyzer. The ability of insulin to dispose of a glucose load was estimated by modification of the ist, as described by shen et al. One catheter was used for the administration of a 180 min infusion of somatostatin ( 250 g / hr ) , insulin ( 25 mu / m / min ) , and glucose. blood was collected every 30 min initially , and then at 10 min intervals from 150 - 180 min of the infusion , to determine the steady state plasma insulin ( sspi ) concentration. Data were tested for normal distribution using the kolmogorov - smirnov test and for homogeneity of variances with levene 's test. Male subjects in the current study had higher blood pressures and lower hdlc levels than the female subjects. The other mets clinical characteristics measured did not differ significantly between male and female subjects ( table 1 ) The sspg levels were highest in the sbp and fpg clinical characteristics. The trend of higher sspG levels was associated with more mets clinical characteristics ( fig . 1 , 2 ) However, only the bmi , fpg , and tg in both males and females had significantly higher sSpg levels in the upper quartile.  ir is clearly associated with obesity , whether generalized or central. The detrimental influence of central adiposity on ir is thought to be mediated by intra - abdominal fat deposition. The relationships between ir and some of the mets clinical characteristics were affected by gender. Other than blood pressure , the relationships between Iris and hdlc were also different between the genders. There are two possibilities to explain the metabolic differences which existed between males and females in our study. First, male subjects tend to have more upper truncal adiposity ( i.e. , a higher waist - to-hip ratio [ whr ] ) than female subjects. Second, males might be more prone to develop mets when in middle age. It is generally recognized that one of the main underlying pathophysiologies of glucose intolerance is ir. In subjects who already have ir , due to the compensatory increased secretion of the insulin , the fpg may persist within the normal range. There was no relationship found between fpg and ir ( 35 ) in our study. The ir is more correlated with lipids profile and bmi , but less with the blood pressure. Adiposity , higher fpg , and hypertriglyceridemia are more strongly associated with ir in chinese subjects. When considering each of the mets clinical characteristics , subjects with a higher bmi may have the highest ir.\",\n",

Only 10% of the clinicians had used referral guidelines , which is worrying and significantly lower than studies from the developed world. There is a need for increasing awareness about radiation exposure among referral clinicians in our region. It is advisable to put more emphasis on the radiation protection courses and education , as well as justification of referral for imaging among students and clinicians of all specialties at graduate and postgraduate level. The endeavors to improve referral practices also have to target clinician 's attitudes in addition to their knowledge enhancement.\",\n",
       " \"a 44 -year - old male patient was admitted to the hospital for surgical removal of a duodenal submucosal tumor. prior to anesthetic induction , the patient 's blood pressure ( bp) was 130/75 mmhg and his heart rate ( hr ) was 74/min. during the initial manipulation of the tumor , the patients bp was 250/120 mmhG and tachycardic. despite the adequate depth of anesthesia and anti - hypertensive therapy , subsequently , an additional dose of nicardipine hydrochloride 300 g was administered. An undiagnosed extra - adrenal pheo was suspected based on the hypertensive crisis caused by tumor manipulation. A biopsy showed that the tumor was a well - encapsulated , solid mass measuring 5.5  4.0  3.7 cm. The patient was transferred to the general ward on postoperative day ( pod ) 2 and was discharged on pod 11 without any complications. A follow up appointment was scheduled for six months after the surgery to investigate any evidence of recurrence and to monitor signs of lymph node metastasis. Sustained or paroxysmal hypertension has been reported in 80 - 100% of patients. The main manifestation of sympathetic pgl is hypertension. This type of tumor is usually localized in the thorax or the abdomen. Parasympathetic pgls are mostly localized around the head and neck. These tumors are nonfunctional and biochemically silent. Gists are large - sized tumors arising from the stomach with heterogeneous enhancement and central necrosis. When there are neither symptoms of catecholamine excess nor histologic diagnosis , gist has a similar radiographic appearance to pgl. The genetic association of nonfamilial pgl , gist , and pulmonary chondroma ( carney triad) has been described in a very small number of patients. Surgical procedures involving an unexpected pgl without proper preoperative management lead to an increase in morbidity and mortality. elective surgical procedures should be canceled or delayed until the origin of the hypertensive episode can be clarified. once the diagnosis of pgl has been confirmed, complete surgical resection of the tumor is the treatment of choice. Pgl is very difficult to diagnose during preoperative patient evaluation as it has either no symptoms or atypical symptoms. If acute hemodynamic instability occurs during induction of anesthesia or surgical manipulation , one should suspect pgl. In cases of metastatic or unresectable disease, i - mibg therapy is the standard alternative therapy option.\",\n",

       " 'Contrast thresholds for detecting the presence of a sinewave grating with horizontal bars were determined using a two temporal - interval forced - choice paradigm. Grating stimuli were generated using a vsg2/5 video card and presented on a sony 24 graphics display. The contrast of the grating decreased by one step following two consecutive trials with correct responses. Two males and three females, mean age = 25.8  9.9 years participated in this study. The five observers with normal vision all had best - corrected visual acuity ( bcva ) of at least 20/20 in each eye. All observers in the low vision group had bilateral vision loss , with a bcva of 0.14 logmar ( 20/25 snellen equivalent ) or worse. Free - fit was accomplished by fitting a low - vision csf using equation 1 and allowing all four parameters to vary. template - fit also made use of equation 1 but with the two parameters constrained to the values returned for the best - fit function for the normal - vision data. We compared several key parameters of the fitted functions derived from the two fitting methods to determine how well these parameters correlate or agree with each other. Five observers with normal vision all had best - corrected visual acuity ( bcva ) of at least 20/20 in each eye. all observers in the low vision group had bilateral vision loss with a bcva of 0.14 logmar ( 20/25 snellen equivalent ) or worse in the better eye. Diagnoses included amd , stargardt disease , glaucoma and optic neuropathy.  curve - fitting was performed using igor pro ( wavemetrics , inc . , lake oswego , or , usa ) using a levenberg - marquardt iterative algorithm. free - fit was accomplished by fitting a low - vision csf using equation 1 and allowing all four parameters to vary. template - fit also made use of equation 1 but with the two parameters constrained to the values returned for the best - fit function for the normal - vision data. Figure 2 shows the contrast sensitivity versus spatial frequency data of our group of normal vision observers. Each data point represents the sensitivity ( reciprocal of contrast threshold ) based on 16 reversals ( 8 reversals per staircase for 2 staircases ) The data are color - coded : red for observers with central field loss and blue for those with intact central field. We fit the data set using the asymmetric parabolic function ( equation 1 ) We compared the sum of the aic of the two fitting methods across all low - vision eyes. Aic is given by  k where k is the number of free parameters ( 4 for free - fit and 2 for template - fit ) using this method, the sum is 231.2 for the free -fit method and 231.1 for the template -fit. We examined the correlation and agreement of three key parameters. These parameters are the peak contrast sensitivity ( csp ) , the spatial frequency at peak contrastensitivity ( sFP ) and the high cutoff spatial frequency. The parameters derived from the two fitting methods are in good agreement. The main results do not change if we consider only data for eyes with central field loss. Given our hypothesis of low - vision csfs having the same shape as the normal csf , it is important to compare the parameters that govern the shape of the fitted functions. These are the widthl and widthr parameters. Free - fit method yields a fitted curve with a shallower low - frequency decline than that returned by the template fit. Means of the two distributions are very close to the constrained values. Results suggest that low - vision csfs can be related to a normal csf with two additional measurements. A practical question is whether letter - chart acuity , a clinical measurement performed on every clinical patient, can predict some of the key parameters. The correlation between csp and acuity is weak, but there is a high correlation between sFP and the high cutoff spatial frequency. letter - chart acuity can explain 58% and 62% of the variances in sfp and theHigh cutoff spatial Frequency. The 95% limits of agreement are 0.28 log units , larger than the test - retest reliability. uity measurement of 0.1 to 0.2 log units . in addition , the mean acuity difference between the high cutoff spatial frequency and chart acuity is 0.15 logmar , which is statistically different from a null difference ( p = 0.0002 ) . these results show that in general , using the conversion that 20/20 letters correspond to 30 c / deg , the letter - chart yields a poorer acuity than the high cut-off spatial frequency. There are several key methodologic differences between our study and that of rohaly and owsley. We used a two temporal interval forced - choice paradigm combined with a staircase procedure. We found that a template based on the average data of a group of normally - sighted observers provides a reasonably good fit to individual data of 20 low - vision eyes. The close coupling between the low- and normal - vision csfs does not even require the normal vision template to be derived from age - matched control observers. The rates of fall - off of contrast sensitivity with spatial frequency differ for the left and right branches of the csf with respect to csp. We chose an asymmetric parabolic function to fit our data. We showed that a model with only two free parameters might be sufficient. The csf of the low - vision individual can be approximated by shifting a normal csf template leftward along the log sf axis by 0.5 log units to account for the difference in acuity. The shape of a csf is stimulus - dependent and may change with stimulus parameters such as luminance, retinal eccentricity, field size, duration and temporal characteristics of the gratings. Future investigations may wish to establish their own normal template to ensure the best fitting of their low- vision data. Full low - vision csfs can be used as filters to recreate visual stimuli that simulate what individuals with low vision can detect. This may be a useful tool for informal evaluation of the impact of vision impairment on visibility of real - world objects and scenes. More sophisticated models of feature visibility may include multiple spatial - frequency channels and the ability to represent local luminance - dependent variations.',\n",

None of the animals observed had white oval scars caused by the cookiecutter shark or was infested with pennella copepods. Symptoms of pulmonary edema were observed in all 44 cases examined in this study. Five adult whales had no stomach contents and no significant pathological changes in the organs. Two neonates and two sucklings were also severely emaciated. Many neutrophils , lymphocytes and macrophages infiltrated into the alveoli causing hemorrhage and congestion of the interalveolar septa. There are 14 known species in the world within the genus mesoplodon. The number of stranding reports for the stejneger s beaked whale has been increasing in japan. Because their lungs are not lobulated, pulmonary edema tends to affect not partially , but diffusely and severely. Right heart failure was not observed in any of the cases we examined.  crassicauda nematodes are known to occur in various species of cetaceans including the stejneger s beaked whale. They cause purulent exudate and necrosis of the mucosa.

       " 'Mouth care is an integral part of personal care yet it is inadequate and given low priority for residents in long - term care. Poor oral hygiene resulting from inadequate mouth care causes considerable morbidity such as mucosal inflammation and caries. Those with dementia experience even higher rates of oral disease. Oral care for dependent older adults in long-term care is becoming a challenge that is expected to grow in importance as our population ages. Oral health care has traditionally been peripheral to mainstream health considerations. Lack of interaction between dentistry and other domains of health has fostered isolation in approaches for managing oral health. This has been recognized as a shortcoming and has resulted in a call for an interdisciplinary and collaborative approach to both research and practice. This paper describes the experience of developing a meaningful interdisciplinary collaboration. Three long - term care facilities were examined during a provincial oral health policy workshop. They are rurally situated within 1 hour of each other and are within 1 - 2-hour drive of a metropolitan area. The number of residents per site ranged from 25 to 40 , which is typical of the majority of long-term care facilities found in rural settings. The term oral care connotes the broad spectrum of oral health care needs associated with both professional and personal care. This research is primarily concerned with the latter ,  daily mouth care for frail older adults. The process and outcomes associated with the implementation of actions are being evaluated and are providing the basis of recommendations to revise organizational policy and oral care practice.  qualitative methods are particularly well suited to finding answers to  what  questions ( what are people doing , what does it mean ) and  how  questions are asked. ethics approval was obtained from the nova scotia capital district health authority. One - on - one semistructured interviews were held with administrators and health professionals who provide a variety of health services. The workshop included 68 participants from a variety of perspectives and disciplines. Findings from the workshop were collated and synthesized into a draft oral care action plan for integration at each of the three long - term care sites. Details of the action plan were prepared into a report and relevant materials circulated to the site team for final approval. 13 one - on- one semistructured interviews were undertaken with administrators and health professionals who service the three facilities. scan revealed a general lack of specific reference to oral health and oral care. external professionals recognized the importance of oral care but generally felt removed from oral care and its implications. neither group was aware of existing formal policies or supports related to oral care in long - term care.  focus groups held at each of the three sites included 17 residents and family members ( n = 8 , 3,6 ) and 14 front - line personal care providers. Residents expressed feedback about availability of mouth care products and good communication between care staff and residents. Residents associated mouth care with professional dental care. Front line care staff most involved with the day - to- day care of residents identified numerous factors that either hindered or helped with carrying out these tasks. Although oral care is included in their personal care training , many felt a repulsion and lack of comfort ( fear ) when providing mouth care. This was intensified when residents exhibit resistant behavior as a result of dementia. One - day interdisciplinary workshop was held to develop an oral care action plan to be integrated into organizational policy and practice. There was some overlap between topics but feedback was collated into the following summaries. education / training required to strengthen the delivery of daily oral care education for residents may be important to heighten awareness. Oral health kits should be created for each resident including the necessary tools to complete oral care. Care cards should be developed and color coded according to tooth and denture status. A tool to enable personal care providers to conduct oral assessments as a part of providing oral care should beDevelop a strategy for including oral care in dysphagia assessment. Dental servicesthis is an issue that needs to involve everyone from frontline care staff , senior administration , to government. taking residents to a dentist requires funding for transportation in addition to the cost of service. oral care could be set up similar to foot care where a mobile unit makes site visits.  success in oral health programs in long - term care is contingent upon effective programmatic strategies. The evaluation plan was designed to examine the institutional context and to consider both organizational culture and the programmatic Strategies arising from the oral care action plan. The document scan revealed significant gaps in policy , education , and clinical standards available to guide oral care in long-term care.

       " 'standard biologic specimens containing infectious ebov commonly generated in high - level biocontainment operations were inactivated by several methods of chemical treatment. For in vitro testing , we used wild - type ebov expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein ( ebov - egFP ) ( 7 ) , which allows for cytopathic effect ( cpe ) and fluorescence as simple readout parameters. For In vivo testing, we used mouse - adapted ebov ( ma - ebov ) ( 8) infection of balb / c mice. Initial sample virus titers were as follows : liquid virus stock ( 1  10 tcid50/ml ) , infected cells ( 1\\xa010 cells / ml ) , blood ( 10\\xa0tcid50\\xa0/mg ) and tissue ( 10tcid 50/mg) Infected cells ( 5  10 cells ) were pelleted by centrifugation and lysed in test reagent ( buffer rlt ; qiagen , valencia , ca , usa ) before addition of trizol (250 l dpbs) For in vitro testing, all samples were increased in volume to 3 ml and equally divided to infect vero e6 cells ( 80% confluency ) in triplicates. cells were incubated at 37c for 14 days and monitored regularly for cpe or fluorescence. For in vivo testing, samples wereincreased inVolume to 1ml and equally divide to infect 5 mice intraperitoneally. mice were housed in microisolator cages and were monitored daily for 28 days. because in vitro and in vivo safety testing correlated well , we discontinued mouse infections for ethical reasons.  infected liver segments were incubated in 10% neutral - buffered formalin , 2% glutaraldehyde , or 2% paraformaldehyde ( 10 ml) for a period of 7 days ( < 1-cm piece ) or 30 days. A small section of tissue ( 150 mg) was dissected , homogenized in dpbs with a stainless steel bead ( 10 min at 30 hz ) , and then dialyzed. All samples were completely inactivated as indicated by lack of cpe or fluorescence in cells and clinical signs in mice. Our study establishes inactivation procedures for ebov that can be safely applied to distinct specimen types and research purposes. Our findings should help to improve and approve sops for inactivation without the need for safety testing each individual sample. All treated cells and tissue homogenates were negative for infectious ebov.',\n",
       " \" neonatal jaundice is recognized as a source of significant neonatal morbidity , mortality , or life - long sequelae in some survivors. kernicterus is the devastating sequelae of severe , unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The determinants of vulnerability to and reversibility of this condition are still only partially understood. ases . in earlier work from our group we have hypothesized a protective role of this oxidative action against bilirubin toxicity in the brain. The purpose herein was to investigate whether inhibition of this apparent enzyme activity would affect cell survival. We elected to use metyrapone , a drug with specific inhibitory effects on cytochrome p450 activity. cell death was quantitated by staining for apoptosis and necrosis followed by flow cytometry.  neuroblastoma cells possessed the same bilirubin oxidizing ability as described in previous studies performed on rat and rabbit brains. cells were seeded out in polystyrene plates ( 12 wells ) and incubated for 24  h at 37  c in 5% co2 for all incubations. After 24 h, the supernatant was removed and 1  ml fresh rpmi without serum was added to each well. Neuroblastoma cells from the cell line chp212 ( atcc - crl2273 ) were used in the experiments. The chosen concentration of metyrapone was based on available literature on its uptake and enzyme inhibition assuming that it diffuses into human cells. All handling of bilirubin was performed in dim light conditions to reduce photo - oxidation. Cells were cultured using 0.1% trypsin and penicillin / streptomycin in a humidified , 5% co2 , 37  c incubator. annexin - v - fluos, a marker of apoptosis, was purchased from roche. propidium iodide, which binds to intracellular dna indicating cell membrane rupture, was bought from sigma - aldrich. Cells were incubated either with bilirubin 75  m , metyrapone 250  m or both for 24  h at 37  c in 5% co2. Cells were trypsinated for 35  min at room temperature and then removed with cold rpmi without serum and centrifuged at 4  c for flow cytometric analyses. The individual samples were stained with annexin - v and propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry for apoptosis and necrosis. The mean viability of the chp2 - 12 cells in the metyrapone group remained unchanged compared to the control group. bilirubin 75  m caused a significant ( p  <  0.05 ) reduction of viability , from 84.1 ( sem 2.0 ) to 66.6% (Sem 2.7 ) ( fig .  1 ) However, adding 250  m metyrarapone to the biliruba exposed cells did not alter cell viability.  mitochondrial oxidase is a putative intracellular protective factor against the cytotoxic effect of unconjugated bilirubin in the brain. We have confirmed that the human neuroblastoma cells we have used as a model system do possess the oxidative capacity found in previous studies. In mitochondrial membrane preparations from these cells the activity was inhibited by metyrapone.  mitochondrial preparations from one selected cell line compared to the ones obtained from whole animal brains. The finding that chemically blocking intracellular bilirubin oxidation did not affect the viability of the cells leads to a series of new questions. The lack of positive results may indicate that they are less suited as a model for more vulnerable neonatal neuronal cells. We still can not rule out the possible cytoprotective role of this enzymatic activity in unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia affecting the central nervous system. , we still can't rule out\\xa0the possible cy toprotective\\xa0role of this\\xa0enzymatic\\xa0activity in\\xa0conjugated\\xa0hyperbilirubsia affecting\\xa0the central\\xa0nervous system.\",\n",
       " 'Cinnamomum cassia, c. burmannii and c. loureiroi cinnamons are the main species of cinnamon. cinnamon has been associated with a variety of beneficial health effects. cinnamon bark is reportedly used for the treatment of a wide range of conditions, including digestive disorders and diabetes.  flow injection mass spectrometric ( fims ) fingerprinting can be used to profile phytochemicals and discriminate between botanical materials. The patterns of the fims fingerprints have been successfully used to distinguish plant genera, species , and even farming methods. The method is the fast method development and analysis time compared to traditional liquid chromatography ( lc - ms) The cinnamon samples were collected in 20092011. The samples were sourced and vetted through the company s global sourcing division. The identity of each sample was confirmed by mccormick s internal chemotaxonomic methods. samples were ground in a schutte  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 hammermill or a brinkman restch zm-1 centrifugal mill. Quaternary pump with a vacuum degasser, a thermostated column compartment, an autosampler, and a diode array detector ( dad ) were used. electrospray ionization ( esi ) was performed in positive ion mode from m / z 100 to 2000 to obtain the fims fingerprints. The mass spectrum for each sample consisted of a one - dimensional matrix ( ion counts versus mass for m /Z 1002000) The first  goal of this study was to differentiate the four different species of cinnamon samples without chromatography. electrospray ionization ( esi) was performed in the positive ion mode to obtain the hrms data. The fims fingerprint for each sample was obtained as the average of all spectra between 0.4 and 1.0 min.  differences among the four species of cinnamon are quite obvious visually even though no chromatographic separation was performed. The advantage of using pca to process the ms fingerprints is automation and simplification. pca provides visual patterns that are math - based but still aesthetically and statistically useful. High molecular weight ions ( m / z 865 , 904 , 1192 , and 1442 ) tend to position  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 the samples to the right of the pca score plot. The low molecular  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 weight ions shifted sample positions more to the left side of the  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 plots. Coumarin and a - type proanthocyanidins give higher pc2 scores, whereas the b-type proanthOCyanidin give lower pc2 Scores. cinnamon improves glucose and lipid levels of people with type 2 diabetes. Neither group attempted to identify the cinnamon samples by source or characterize the composition. Both of the human feeding studies used cc, which contained more type - b than type - a proanthocyanidins. cc was chosen for both studies instead of cb or cv , nor were there any reports on the comparison of different cinnamon samples in human studies. The results  show the importance of analytically determining the chemical composition of the samples.',\n",
       " 'lesions in the thalamus and those extending into the midbrain can cause various movement disorders such as dystonia , asterixis , and ballism - chorea. convulsive movements have been reported in bilateral paramedian thalamic and midbrain infarction. we report on the case of a patient with clonic movements of both arms that were observed at the onset ofinfarction and offer a review of the literature. The mesencephalic rf has a crucial role in the generation of convulsive seizures in bilateral paramedian thalamic and midbrain infarction. seizures can take a variety of motor patterns depending on the intensity of stimulation. High intensity stimulation causes tonic movements, whereas a low intensity causes clonic movements of the forelimbs.']"
